Loading MentalBERT model and tokenizer...
Some weights of BertModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at mental/mental-bert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['pooler.dense.bias', 'pooler.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
