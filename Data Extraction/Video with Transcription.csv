00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.753
anxiety can make it FEEL like there's something physically wrong with you

00:00:03.754 --> 00:00:04.905
even when there's notâ¦

00:00:04.914 --> 00:00:08.993
here are 4 WEIRD physical symptoms that can actually be caused by anxiety

00:00:08.994 --> 00:00:11.153
from a licensed therapist and certified trauma professional

00:00:11.154 --> 00:00:12.233
make sure you listen to the last

00:00:12.234 --> 00:00:14.145
it tends to catch the most people off guard

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.349
1) anxiety can make your throat feel sore or tight

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.070
even like there is a literal âlump in your throatâ

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.509
this is referred to as a âglobus sensationâ in medical terms

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.310
and is a direct result of muscle bracing from anxiety

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.854
2) disrupted breathing

00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:29.423
either difficulty getting a full breathâ¦

00:00:29.424 --> 00:00:31.823
tightness in chest or heart palpitations

00:00:31.824 --> 00:00:35.623
the fight/flight response as a component of anxiety prioritizes oxygen

00:00:35.624 --> 00:00:39.823
and therefore bloodflow to the muscles & away from your internal organs

00:00:39.824 --> 00:00:42.275
this can make breathing feel weird & labored

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.830
3) numbness, dizziness or tingling

00:00:44.831 --> 00:00:47.590
remember since bloodflow is prioritized to the muscles

00:00:47.591 --> 00:00:48.127
a lot of times

00:00:48.128 --> 00:00:51.230
this means that tingling will come to the muscles in the appendages â

00:00:51.231 --> 00:00:52.548
your arms and legs

00:00:52.551 --> 00:00:55.208
while dizziness or lightheadedness is common due to 

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:56.588
LACK of oxygen in the brain

00:00:56.631 --> 00:00:59.388
4) depersonalization & derealization

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.106
these out of body body experiences can feel REALLY weird & scary

00:01:03.153 --> 00:01:06.466
but they're directly connected to the elevated levels of adrenaline

00:01:06.473 --> 00:01:09.506
in your bloodstream from the fight or flight response from anxiety

00:01:09.713 --> 00:01:11.632
this can look like your limbs feeling strange

00:01:11.633 --> 00:01:13.152
your face looking weird in the mirror

00:01:13.153 --> 00:01:14.312
life feeling unreal

00:01:14.313 --> 00:01:15.986
feeling detached from reality

00:01:16.113 --> 00:01:17.312
feeling disconnected from your body

00:01:17.313 --> 00:01:19.266
or like everything is moving in slow motion

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.920
if your symptoms are negatively impacting your life

00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:24.480
consider learning more about managing your mental health

00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:26.400
regulating your central nervous system

00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:28.040
and even reaching out to a professional

00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:30.738
for help with managing or reducing those symptoms

00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:32.658
life doesn't have to be like that

00:01:32.921 --> 00:01:34.378
and you don't have to suffer alone

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.135
The first 9 signs of anxiety are shortness of breath.

00:00:04.206 --> 00:00:06.095
The second has trouble sleeping at night.

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:08.410

The 7th finger or hand is shaking.

00:00:17.694 --> 00:00:20.892
the 8th overeats or has no appetite

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
Here are my 3 top tips as a therapist

00:00:02.511 --> 00:00:05.228
to overcome health anxiety.

00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:10.628
Number one, you have to recognize what's happening.

00:00:10.791 --> 00:00:13.108
If we don't name it as health anxiety,

00:00:13.551 --> 00:00:14.870
we tend to continue

00:00:14.871 --> 00:00:17.068
going round and round with the patterns

00:00:17.231 --> 00:00:19.748
because we're trying to think our way

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.330
to a feeling of safety.

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:23.770
If you can name it as health anxiety,

00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:26.410
you can address the health anxiety

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:29.650
as opposed to trying to address the symptoms,

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:31.610
which may not be the real issue.

00:00:32.463 --> 00:00:36.156
Secondly, we have to then break the pattern.

00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:38.636
If you can recognize what's happening,

00:00:38.863 --> 00:00:39.942
you then have to stop

00:00:39.943 --> 00:00:42.956
the habits and the behaviors that perpetuate the cycle.

00:00:43.183 --> 00:00:44.982
So the constant checking of symptoms,

00:00:44.983 --> 00:00:46.422
researching of symptoms,

00:00:46.423 --> 00:00:48.596
looking for reassurance about symptoms.

00:00:48.783 --> 00:00:50.796
We have to break those patterns and cycles.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.228
And then thirdly,

00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:53.468
the recognition

00:00:53.751 --> 00:00:56.828
that what health anxiety often really is

00:00:57.071 --> 00:00:59.548
is an inner sense of not feeling safe.

00:00:59.631 --> 00:01:02.988
So if we can work on calming your nervous system

00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:06.508
and cultivating that inner state of safety,

00:01:07.137 --> 00:01:09.576
you won't need to have those health anxieties

00:01:09.577 --> 00:01:10.762
in the first place.

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:12.416
To learn how to do that,

00:01:12.417 --> 00:01:15.282

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.711
For anxiety specifically,

00:00:02.108 --> 00:00:03.351
what can people do

00:00:03.428 --> 00:00:05.827
to make sure that they're not so much of a victim

00:00:05.828 --> 00:00:07.947
to that feeling of overwhelming anxiety

00:00:07.948 --> 00:00:09.587
that can just creep up on them every single day?

00:00:09.588 --> 00:00:10.791
So 4 simple things.

00:00:10.828 --> 00:00:13.111
Never leave a situation because you're anxious,

00:00:13.268 --> 00:00:15.467
because then the anxiety will control you.

00:00:15.468 --> 00:00:19.197
Breathe 2 minutes 3x1 day.

00:00:19.198 --> 00:00:20.280
This will save you

00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:23.520
like thousands of dollars of therapy if you do this.

00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:26.560
It's the 15 second breath for 2 minutes.

00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:27.938
So that's 8 breaths

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.360
4 seconds in,

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.939
hold it for a second and 1/2

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.560
8 seconds out.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.080
So double the exhale as the inhale,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.707
hold it out for a second and 1/2.

00:00:37.708 --> 00:00:38.947
That's 15 seconds.

00:00:38.948 --> 00:00:40.067
Repeat times 8.

00:00:40.068 --> 00:00:42.631
It just feels like you took a Valium

00:00:42.668 --> 00:00:44.071
without any side effects.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.099
Do that 3x1 day.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.899
Your level of anxiety is going to go way down.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.839
And then whenever you feel sad,

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.979
mad, nervous,

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:51.979
or out of control,

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.179
write down what you're thinking

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.939
and then just ask yourself if it's true.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.059
And learning to kill the ants.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.699
The automatic negative thoughts.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.839
It's miraculous.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.860
Hi, I'm Josh,

00:00:00.861 --> 00:00:03.341
an anxiety therapist and previous sufferer.

00:00:03.342 --> 00:00:07.261
Here are 10 signs that you're struggling with an anxiety disorder.

00:00:07.262 --> 00:00:10.261
The first sign is an obsession with how you feel.

00:00:10.262 --> 00:00:12.621
You suddenly feel weird, different to how you used to,

00:00:12.622 --> 00:00:15.261
and you feel the sense of doom and trepidation.

00:00:15.262 --> 00:00:18.641
The second sign is you're bombarded with what if thoughts,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.660
scary what if thoughts, not the fun ones,

00:00:20.661 --> 00:00:22.181
usually about your sanity,

00:00:22.182 --> 00:00:24.261
your well being, your health.

00:00:24.262 --> 00:00:27.901
The third sign, a strange symptoms that feel magnified.

00:00:27.902 --> 00:00:31.741
Heart palpitations, maybe feel dissociated and not quite here.

00:00:31.742 --> 00:00:34.781
Maybe you feel dizzy, lightheaded and things just look strange.

00:00:34.782 --> 00:00:36.761
No. 4 is intrusive thoughts,

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.700
strange taboo

00:00:37.701 --> 00:00:40.581
ones that you usually don't have or they usually don't bother you.

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:42.381
Suddenly they now feel important.

00:00:42.382 --> 00:00:44.821
Number five is constant reassurance seeking.

00:00:44.822 --> 00:00:46.581
Maybe you've been down a Reddit hole

00:00:46.582 --> 00:00:48.541
constantly asking Doctor, Google,

00:00:48.542 --> 00:00:50.261
yet you're still there in the same place

00:00:50.262 --> 00:00:52.581
trying to find 100% assurance that you're okay.

00:00:52.582 --> 00:00:55.501
Number six is experiencing a lot of panic attacks

00:00:55.502 --> 00:00:57.141
and fearing those panic attacks.

00:00:57.142 --> 00:00:58.381
One hits you out the blue,

00:00:58.382 --> 00:00:59.741
you're not sure what's going on,

00:00:59.742 --> 00:01:01.541
so you monitor for it all day

00:01:01.542 --> 00:01:04.421
because you're afraid of having another panic attack

00:01:04.422 --> 00:01:06.721
and then you build your life around avoiding them.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.720
No.7 is threat monitoring.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.700
You're monitoring either your thoughts or sensations in your body

00:01:12.701 --> 00:01:14.601
looking for the next threat

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.680
or uncomfortable experience that frightens you.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.340
No.8 is you resist and fear the emotion of anxiety.

00:01:21.341 --> 00:01:24.381
You try To get rid of it, maybe you've looked for lots of things like

00:01:24.382 --> 00:01:25.501
how do I get rid of this now?

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:27.001
How to stop a panic attack,

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.580
anything to try and get rid of it.

00:01:28.581 --> 00:01:32.501
And that urgency, No. 9 is that you avoid doing stuff that you used to,

00:01:32.502 --> 00:01:34.341
that what non anxious you would do,

00:01:34.342 --> 00:01:37.341
you've put off because you're waiting to feel better.

00:01:37.342 --> 00:01:40.401
No. 10, anxiety becomes your default thought.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.460
Whenever you're not distracted or busy,

00:01:42.461 --> 00:01:45.061
you check how you feel and it's the default thought.

00:01:45.062 --> 00:01:47.981
I must fix myself, I must work on this,

00:01:47.982 --> 00:01:51.301
I must get rid of this. And it becomes the centre of your life.

00:01:51.302 --> 00:01:53.261
I've been there. I've got through it.

00:01:53.262 --> 00:01:55.281
So inspired me to be a therapist.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.560
And if this resonates, my work in this page might help.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.031
If you actually have ever suffered from

00:00:02.032 --> 00:00:04.027
or know somebody who suffered from anxiety,

00:00:04.352 --> 00:00:06.151
if you ask them 3 questions,

00:00:06.152 --> 00:00:09.191
you can find out very quickly that their anxiety

00:00:09.192 --> 00:00:11.187
is not coming from a cluster of symptoms.

00:00:11.312 --> 00:00:13.227
It's not coming from their outside environment.

00:00:13.272 --> 00:00:14.747
It is coming from within them.

00:00:14.792 --> 00:00:16.267
It's coming from their physiology.

00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.565
I mean, if you know someone who's suffering from anxiety

00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:19.952
and you say,

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:20.773
well, have you

00:00:21.126 --> 00:00:23.573
had anxiety on and off throughout your lifetime,

00:00:24.046 --> 00:00:25.733
the most of the time they'll say yes.

00:00:26.246 --> 00:00:26.885
And then if you say,

00:00:26.886 --> 00:00:29.333
can you point to the specific trigger that causes it?

00:00:30.006 --> 00:00:31.373
Very often they'll say, no.

00:00:32.126 --> 00:00:33.965
I mean, yes, I know some of my triggers,

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.245
but I could be sitting in a podcast just like this

00:00:36.246 --> 00:00:37.312
in a very calm environment,

00:00:37.313 --> 00:00:38.245
there's no threats around,

00:00:38.246 --> 00:00:40.333
and all of a sudden I get overwhelmed by anxiety.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.758
I can be driving home from work

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:43.420
on an otherwise innocuous day,

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:45.220
and I can be overwhelmed by anxiety.

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:47.558
Well, that is not coming from your outside environment,

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.958
right? This is coming from a process called methylation.

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:51.598
So the body is entering this mild

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:55.300
fighter flight response without the presence of a fear.

What is the most common cause for panic attacks?

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.740
That's, um,

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.700
adrenal overload. Most,

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.720
most of the time, nutritionally speaking,

00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:12.741
it's a low vitamin B1. So,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.760
I mean, I think you should do an experiment

00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:16.481
and this would be a great experiment.

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:18.221
If you're in a panic attack,

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.680
just take some be one and just watch what happens.

00:00:20.681 --> 00:00:21.721
Within about three minutes,

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:23.441
it's like, oh,

00:00:23.442 --> 00:00:24.241
I can, I can breathe.

00:00:24.242 --> 00:00:27.961
I feel calmer. But then the breathing is key too.

00:00:27.962 --> 00:00:30.601
You don't wanna hyperventilate when you have a panic attack.

00:00:30.602 --> 00:00:32.261
You wanna slow the breathing down

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.840
in for about four seconds and out for four seconds.

00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:38.861
And that will pull yourself out of a panic attack.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.620
Believe it or not, the more you breathe,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.600
you're thinking you're getting more oxygen,

00:00:43.601 --> 00:00:46.661
but it's locking, it's locking up, um,

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.360
your oxygen. So

00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:52.741
you need a certain amount of CO2 to allow the oxygen to be exchanged.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.004
Depression can become so severe

00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:03.964
that you lose touch with reality

00:00:03.965 --> 00:00:05.844
and develop psychotic symptoms.

00:00:05.845 --> 00:00:07.284
These psychotic symptoms

00:00:07.285 --> 00:00:09.284
are delusions and hallucinations.

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:11.924
However, delusions tend to be more common

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:13.244
than the hallucinations.

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:15.724
The delusions can take on a persecutory

00:00:15.725 --> 00:00:17.335
or nihilistic tone.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.258
Persecutory is when you feel attacked in some way.

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:22.818
You may feel like people are talking about you

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:24.058
or trying to harm you.

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:25.378
And on several occasions,

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:28.098
I've seen people who were delusionally depressed

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.578
and felt that people were coming into their home.

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.058
Nihilistic delusions are when you feel

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.618
that things are senseless

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:36.160
and they've lost their value.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.147
Like, what's the point in life?

00:00:38.148 --> 00:00:39.347
Nothing matters.

00:00:39.348 --> 00:00:41.387
And this can be some of the thought behind

00:00:41.388 --> 00:00:43.067
a person not wanting to live

00:00:43.068 --> 00:00:44.872
in making a suicide attempt.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.422
Sometimes suicide attempts are impulsive,

00:00:47.423 --> 00:00:48.215
but sometimes

00:00:48.216 --> 00:00:51.102
they're born out of these nihilistic delusions

00:00:51.103 --> 00:00:52.462
that nothing matters.

00:00:52.463 --> 00:00:54.902
So why does even anyone exist?

00:00:54.903 --> 00:00:57.356
Even existence is senseless.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.545
I'm psychologist and here's something i want to share with you. 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:03.933
When you feel 

00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:08.107
down, it's not because your malfunctioning or your brain is faulty in any way. 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.532
It's information. 

00:00:09.626 --> 00:00:13.571
It's your brain telling you that you have some needs that aren't being met. 

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:18.411
Your job is to work out what they are and start meeting them.
