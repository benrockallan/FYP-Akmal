Get unstuck + level up your life ↴","Nervous system regulating activities for anger, sadness, and anxiety (read until the end) ↴

For anger:
→ Gorilla thumps
→ Alternating fists to the floor
→ Alternating stomps
→ Full body shake out (can be followed by stillness)

Sadness:
→ Butterfly taps
→ Alternating pressure / self-hugs
→ Bamboo sways

Anxiety:
→ Alternating self throw + catch (can move this around your body)
→ Rise and fall stomach breaths with prop

These techniques I show in the video and list below are examples of “bottom-up” nervous system regulating activities which are often a missed critical piece in many people’s healing and growth approaches.

To get daily activities from me within an easy to follow practice that teaches you how to proactively and responsively regulate your nervous system and get unstuck from your patterns, DM me “Seminar” and I’ll send you more information about my Seven Centers Life School 💌

Although passing a box of tissues may be a well intentioned act of compassion, in the therapy room it can have undertones of ""Don't cry,"" ""Stop crying,"" ""Clean up,"" etc. 

Different therapists handle this differently. I set my tissues near the client and allow them to grab them, if they want to. 

Remember, while many may relate to this, it may not be your experience.

My Journey | Psychology Notes","Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) exercises have proven to be effective in enhancing flexibility in one's thinking style. This therapeutic approach, developed by prominent psychologists, focuses on identifying and challenging negative thought patterns and replacing them with more balanced and realistic ones. CBT exercises help individuals recognize cognitive distortions, such as black-and-white thinking or catastrophizing, which can limit their ability to see alternative perspectives. By engaging in structured exercises, individuals are encouraged to examine the evidence supporting their beliefs and explore alternative explanations. This process promotes cognitive flexibility by loosening rigid thought patterns and opening up possibilities for different interpretations. CBT exercises also involve experimenting with new behaviors and examining their outcomes, allowing individuals to challenge their assumptions and develop more adaptive ways of thinking. Through repetition and practice, individuals can gradually shift their thinking style, becoming more open-minded, adaptable, and resilient in the face of challenges. This increased flexibility in thinking enables individuals to approach situations with a broader perspective, consider multiple solutions, and effectively adapt to changing circumstances. Ultimately, CBT exercises empower individuals to break free from cognitive rigidity, leading to improved mental well-being and a more fulfilling life.  #therapytok #therapistsontiktok #therapytools #cbt #journalideas "

My Journey | Psychology Notes","Journaling in this way doesn’t make your problems go away.  It increases your awareness allowing you to think more flexibly.  Over time, you might uncover deeper issues within yourself that need more attention.  For example: you may learn that you make a lot of assumptions about others or that you often feel misunderstood.  With that information, you can learn more about these triggers and find new ways to manage or tolerate them.  #therapytiktok #therapytools #therapistsontiktok #journalwithme #healingjourneys "

📚 Resources & courses ⬇️","Do you suffer from high-functioning depression? Here are 3 signs  ⬆️

High-functioning depression describes individuals who continue to manage their daily tasks and seem to be functioning well while dealing with symptoms of depression. 
This form of depression can cause the same symptoms but tend to be less intense, allowing people to perform well at work, fulfil social obligations and handle their responsibilities. 

Due to its subtlety, high-functioning depression might be easily overlooked, by both healthcare professionals and individuals themselves. But it can significantly impact one’s quality of life, so recognising the signs of high-functioning depression can help individuals take steps to manage their mental health and get the support they need.

📚 Resources & courses ⬇️","Here are 4 harmful lessons emotionally neglected children learn ⬆️ 

We all have 3 core emotional needs. As children, we depend on our primary caregivers to meet these needs. How well they do so teaches us how to meet them for ourselves as we become adults. 

Child emotional neglect is a form of child abuse. It is when a parent consistently fails to respond to the child’s emotional needs. Emotional neglect can happen when a parent is unavailable and unresponsive to the child’s feelings. Examples of childhood emotional neglect can include a parent that withholds or does not show affection, doesn’t offer emotional support and disregards a child’s mental well-being. 

Over time, the emotionally neglected child learns that their needs are not important. As a result, they stop seeking emotional support from their parents as they have learnt that they will only reject their emotions. So this leads to the child feeling overwhelmed and unsure of what to do with their emotions. 

If we are not allowed to feel and process our emotions, they don’t just go away. We disconnect. One of the ways we disconnect is we go into our mind. We retreat into our mind and we lose our ability to be present in the moment.

Allow me to introduce you to the labyrinth of your cranial capacity. Pictured here is an MRI scan, the brain's tell-all confidant. Do you see those green arrows pointing to speckles? They indicate the presence of 'white matter lesions', an unnerving yet cryptic term you may have come across.

But what lies beneath this obscure title? Simply put, white matter lesions are your brain cells that have ceased to exist. 💀

A quick Google search might tell you that these lesions often go unnoticed, becoming almost a normal part of aging. But let me tell you, age is just a number, especially when it comes to your brain health. Having white matter lesions on your MRI scan is anything but normal, regardless of how many candles you blew out on your last birthday cake.🎂

These lesions equate to expired nerve tissue, painting a daunting picture of your brain’s health. The highlighted part below reiterates how these lesions can obstruct vital brain pathways, potentially causing memory issues, balance disorders, and difficulty walking. 🚶‍♀️🧩

A diagnosis of white matter lesions being a normal finding on an MRI scan can be misleading. This is a symptom of an inflamed brain, silently screaming for attention as its tissues give way. 🧠🔥

Feeling a tingle in your brain while reading this? If your neurological symptoms have been persistently nagging you, don't hesitate to reach out. It's time to heed the unvoiced pleas of your brain. 📣

When it comes to wellness, there's a hero ingredient that outshines coconut oil:
 
Caprylic Acid. Sure, you've heard people rave about coconut oil and its purported benefits. Here's the real deal though:
 
Caprylic Acid and coconut oil are NOT the same thing. Here's why:
 
1️⃣ One tablespoon of Caprylic Acid equals a whopping 14 tablespoons of coconut oil. That's right! To gain the equivalent benefits of Caprylic Acid, you'd need to consume 14 times the amount of coconut oil. Why? Only 7% of coconut oil is Caprylic Acid.
 
2️⃣ Now, here's the exciting part. We've got Bulletproof Brain Octane, an excellent source of pure C8 Caprylic Acid. Say goodbye to coconut oil overload!
 
Let's delve into the compelling benefits of Caprylic Acid:
 
🦠 Antimicrobial: Bids farewell to Candida, viruses, and bugs.
🌿 Anti-inflammatory: Helps calm the body's response to irritation.
 
🧠 Brain-Health Booster: Aids in staving off brain degeneration.
 
💥 Mitochondrial Fuel: Caprylic Acid is an excellent fuel source for your cells' powerhouses.
 
My clients usually take one to three tablespoons of Caprylic Acid daily. Imagine, that's equal to 45 tablespoons of coconut oil a day!
 
This is why I champion Caprylic Acid. If you found this eye-opening, do like, comment, and share with someone you care about. Let's spread wellness wisdom together!

🧠MY SELF-HELP BOOK 📖⬇️","❤️‍🩹 Self-harm & suicidality —

These experiences in BPD, while looking similar, are often different than when they show up in depression. For example, people with BPD often experience suicidal breakdowns more often, with more verbalization that they want things to end. But the attempts may not always be as severe… because (in my personal and professional opinion) people with BPD have a level of insight hidden by their behaviors and fears that knows that their pain can be processed if only the right support was available. And that little hidden piece is the piece that I work with.

If you or someone you know needs support, here are some international resources:
•USA: Suicide & Crisis Lifeline - 988
•UK: Samaritans - 116 123
•Canada: Crisis Services Canada - 1-833-456-4566
•Australia: Lifeline - 13 11 14

📚 Overcoming Relationship Anxiety: Available Now! ⬇️","False Memory OCD (a subtype or “theme” of OCD) can present as doubting your ability to accurately recall events. 

This can be bigger things like “what if I una|ived someone and don’t remember” to “smaller” things like “did I make that conversation awkward”

The uncertainty and discomfort can lead to feelings of guilt, shame and panic and the associated compulsions such as mental review, checking, reassurance seeking, etc often lead to even more uncertainty- making you struggle to know fact from fiction at all. 

Like so many subtypes of OCD this can lead to you struggling to trust yourself, and leave you feeling distressed, confused, and afraid. 

OCD can improve with proper support! Freedom from the grip of doubt is possible 💕

📕ARE YOU MAD AT ME? is now available for pre-order!","Calling all people pleasers, perfectionists and peacekeepers: I wrote a book for you - and for my past self. It's a book that I desperately needed.

ARE YOU MAD AT ME? gets to the true root of people pleasing - the fawn response. It's a deeply personal book that unpacks why we worry so much about what others think, why we abandon our needs, and why we shapeshift ourselves to be liked, and it offers a compassionate path forward on how we can break free.

Fawning disconnects us from who we are. It forces us to neglect ourselves as a means of self-protection. My greatest hope is that this book supports you in returning to yourself.

I have so much more to say, but I'll contain myself for now. Just know, I simply cannot wait for you to read it. It’ll be available on August 5th, 2025, and the pre-order link is in my bio. Ahhhh! 🦢@Gallery Books "

As a therapist, I’ve seen so many people struggle to find the right match, and I’ve experienced that frustration myself. That’s why I created Cocoon, something that’s never been done before. It’s about finding a real connection with someone who understands where you’re at.

My hope is that Cocoon becomes the hub for anyone who needs to find a therapist. So far, we’ve already made over 4,000 matches, and I’m so excited to see it grow 🫶🏼

It’s free, it’s easy, and it’s my way of helping you find the right match for your healing. "

📍 London, UK","Avoidant Personality Disorder (AvPD) is a mental health condition characterised by pervasive social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and extreme sensitivity to criticism or rejection. Individuals with AvPD avoid social situations, relationships, and occupational opportunities that involve interpersonal interaction due to intense fear of embarrassment or disapproval. They often perceive themselves as socially inept, unappealing, or inferior, leading to chronic isolation and low self-esteem. AvPD typically develops from a combination of genetic predisposition, early childhood experiences (such as rejection or criticism), and psychological factors.

📍 London, UK","“Multiple personality disorder,” now called dissociative identity disorder (DID), is a rare and complex mental health condition where a person has two or more distinct identity states, each with its own patterns of behaviour, thoughts, and memories. These identity states may alternate in controlling the person’s behavior, often without the individual’s awareness. One of the hallmark symptoms of DID is dissociative amnesia—gaps in memory for personal information, daily events, or even entire periods, usually linked to past traumatic experiences, often from childhood. People with DID may also experience depersonalisation (feeling disconnected from their own body or thoughts) and derealisation (feeling detached from the external world). These symptoms serve as protective mechanisms, helping the mind cope with overwhelming stress.
