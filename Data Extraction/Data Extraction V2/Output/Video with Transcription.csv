00:00:00.282 --> 00:00:02.801
Here are some somatic bilateral stimulation techniques

00:00:02.802 --> 00:00:04.721
you can use to help regulate your nervous system,

00:00:04.722 --> 00:00:07.257
depending upon what emotion you're feeling at the time.

00:00:07.282 --> 00:00:08.841
For anger, you can try Gorilla Thumbs.

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:10.737
So seam here up and down your body.

00:00:10.762 --> 00:00:11.937
None of these should hurt.

00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:14.337
And remember to breathe throughout all these exercises.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.913
Next, you can try alternating fists to the floor,

00:00:16.914 --> 00:00:19.953
releasing energy here and pairing it with our breath.

00:00:19.954 --> 00:00:22.353
We're going to do the same with alternating stomps.

00:00:22.354 --> 00:00:23.913
You should hear a thud on the ground,

00:00:23.914 --> 00:00:24.753
but this again,

00:00:24.754 --> 00:00:25.665
should not hurt.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.708
Lastly, we'll do a full body shake out.

00:00:27.709 --> 00:00:29.230
Don't worry about looking weird.

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:31.148
And this can be followed by stillness,

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:33.550
where you'll focus on slowing your breath.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.261
For sadness,

00:00:34.262 --> 00:00:35.501
you can try out Butterfly Taps

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:36.381
as seen here.

00:00:36.382 --> 00:00:38.701
And all of these Exercises I'm About to Show You

00:00:38.702 --> 00:00:39.861
Are Helping to Activate

00:00:39.862 --> 00:00:41.621
Your Parasympathetic Nervous System.

00:00:41.622 --> 00:00:44.341
Next, you can try Alternating Pressure Self Hugs,

00:00:44.342 --> 00:00:45.398
as seen here.

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:47.381
And remember to breathe throughout this.

00:00:47.382 --> 00:00:48.638
If tears come,

00:00:48.662 --> 00:00:49.918
please let them flow.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.111
Lastly, you can try out bamboo sways,

00:00:52.112 --> 00:00:54.391
where you're alternating your weight from 1ft

00:00:54.392 --> 00:00:55.192
to the other.

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:58.147
And you can add a little bit of self holding here.

00:00:58.272 --> 00:01:01.191
Do this for as long as feels safe and comforting to you.

00:01:01.192 --> 00:01:01.791
For anxiety,

00:01:01.792 --> 00:01:02.911
you're gonna wanna find a prop.

00:01:02.912 --> 00:01:04.147
I just found a stick

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.427
and you're gonna alternate throwing and catching it.

00:01:06.428 --> 00:01:08.791
You can also move this around your body.

00:01:08.988 --> 00:01:10.671
We're just shifting our focus,

00:01:10.748 --> 00:01:13.871
offering bilateral Stimulation and moving our bodies.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.149
Lastly, you can place this prop on your belly

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.829
and watch it move up and down with your breath.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.069
You're gonna wanna make sure to fully inhale and exhale

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.669
and slow your breath here.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.469
Make sure to save this video for later.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.989

00:00:00.242 --> 00:00:02.137
If you feel like this Vine right now,

00:00:02.362 --> 00:00:05.921
so close to your next goal, but just not quite there,

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:08.377
and potentially really frustrated about it,

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:12.097
just remember how far you've already come,

00:00:12.856 --> 00:00:15.135
how many steps you've already made

00:00:15.136 --> 00:00:17.523
to get to where you are currently,

00:00:18.216 --> 00:00:21.895
and how many times you've felt this feeling of being so

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:24.375
close but not quite there,

00:00:24.376 --> 00:00:27.483
and how it eventually comes.

00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.760
DOC, aside from chemotherapy and radiation therapy,

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.520
are there other treatment methods for cancer?

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.920
Hi, I'm Doctor Edilene,

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.000
your nuclear medicine specialist.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.860
And welcome to ask your TMC DOC.

00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:15.401
That's a great question.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.120
While most are familiar with chemotherapy and radiation therapy,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.760
there's actually another groundbreaking approach

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.120
that takes treatment to the next level.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.840
Theranostics, a method which combines therapy and diagnostics

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.440
using specialized radioactive tracers

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.020
to find cancer cells and deliver targeted treatment,

00:00:35.021 --> 00:00:37.761
all with precision and less side effects.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.400
Think of it this way,

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.400
while chemotherapy attacks cells all over your body,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.420
theranostics target cancer cells whilst sparing healthy tissues.

00:00:48.421 --> 00:00:50.881
It's a game changer for the tired, cancer,

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.740
neuroendocrine tumours, prostate cancer and many more.

00:00:54.741 --> 00:00:57.201
But Theronostics isn't just treatment.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.180
It's personalized care designed for you.

00:01:00.181 --> 00:01:02.521
The future of cancer treatment is precise,

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.780
effective and happening now.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.617
When you start an antidepressant,

00:00:01.618 --> 00:00:03.219
the first thing that you experience

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.097
is side effects of the medication.

00:00:05.098 --> 00:00:08.217
So when I see a person a month after starting the drug,

00:00:08.218 --> 00:00:09.217
I usually ask,

00:00:09.218 --> 00:00:10.721
did anything bad happen?

00:00:10.977 --> 00:00:12.381
Because usually the side effects

00:00:12.382 --> 00:00:14.496
like nausea or stomach issues

00:00:14.497 --> 00:00:15.802
or even activation

00:00:16.177 --> 00:00:18.802
like not sleeping well or being energized,

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:20.482
which is different from anxiety,

00:00:20.777 --> 00:00:22.856
these are the things that you see at first,

00:00:22.857 --> 00:00:24.522
and they usually taper off.

00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:28.160
The benefit that you get of reducing your depression

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:29.920
or anxiety comes later,

00:00:29.921 --> 00:00:31.098
as the medication

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:33.960
reaches a steady state level in your body

00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:36.538
and starts to have its therapeutic effect.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.727
Passive suicidal thoughts can become active,

00:00:02.728 --> 00:00:05.407
but many people never make it to the active thought.

00:00:05.408 --> 00:00:08.287
They just ruminate passively in their head.

00:00:08.288 --> 00:00:08.847
And chronic

00:00:08.848 --> 00:00:11.447
passive suicidal thinking is still a problem

00:00:11.448 --> 00:00:13.891
and usually an indication that you're depressed.

00:00:13.928 --> 00:00:15.167
But there are people

00:00:15.168 --> 00:00:18.619
who always think of ending their life as an option

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.939
that they keep open to use when the going gets tough.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.399
It's like this fantasy escape plan,

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.819
but they never really seriously contemplate it

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.319
or get to the point of cashing in on that option.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.899
And this kind of if this and that happen,

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.979
I'll just kill myself

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.419
doesn't necessarily mean that you're depressed,

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.826
but it is a darker way of thinking.

00:00:00.155 --> 00:00:02.274
This person realizes it's Friday

00:00:02.275 --> 00:00:04.864
and their partner hasn't made any plans for the weekend.

00:00:05.115 --> 00:00:06.034
They have the thought,

00:00:06.035 --> 00:00:08.104
they don't care about spending time with me.

00:00:08.435 --> 00:00:09.874
This thought makes them feel hurt,

00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:11.224
annoyed, and angry

00:00:11.515 --> 00:00:13.514
because they've been thinking this thought for a while.

00:00:13.515 --> 00:00:14.424
They're resentful.

00:00:14.875 --> 00:00:15.914
They say to their partner,

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:17.584
I guess we'll just sit home again.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.300
They realize immediately they're mind reading

00:00:20.301 --> 00:00:23.358
and using passive aggressive and contemptuous behavior.

00:00:23.981 --> 00:00:25.660
What makes me think this thought is true?

00:00:25.661 --> 00:00:26.780
If they were excited,

00:00:26.781 --> 00:00:28.180
they would plan something.

00:00:28.181 --> 00:00:30.558
Is there any evidence this might not be true?

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.275
Most of my partner's plans

00:00:32.276 --> 00:00:34.703
since I've known them have always been spontaneous.

00:00:34.916 --> 00:00:36.515
What resources do I have?

00:00:36.516 --> 00:00:38.395
Well, I can talk to my partner about this

00:00:38.396 --> 00:00:40.075
because we clearly have differences

00:00:40.076 --> 00:00:41.743

10 little habits that worsen your mental health

00:00:02.221 --> 00:00:03.681
from a licensed therapist.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.820
No. 1 scrolling your phone first thing in the morning.

00:00:06.821 --> 00:00:10.681
It over stimulates your brain before you even get ready for the day.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.260
Instead, try connecting with a person or even a pet

00:00:14.261 --> 00:00:17.561
and wait 30 minutes before using electronic devices.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.860
No.2 staying inside all day.

00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:21.681
This causes you to feel disconnected,

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.200
sluggish, and often get more anxious.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.340
Instead, go outside,

00:00:25.341 --> 00:00:29.401
even for five minutes. Sunlight and fresh air make a real difference.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.680
No. 3 constantly watching the news.

00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:34.321
It overloads you with negativity and fear.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.720
Instead, limit news to once a day from a trusted source.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.420
No. 4 over comparing yourself to others.

00:00:40.421 --> 00:00:43.961
It distorts your reality and slowly chips away at your self esteem.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.260
Instead, limit your time on social media

00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:50.061
and use comparisons as a way to learn not to put yourself down.

00:00:50.062 --> 00:00:52.021
No. 5 constantly complaining.

00:00:52.022 --> 00:00:54.481
This traps your brain in a cycle of negativity.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.900
Instead, set a timer to vent or worry,

00:00:56.901 --> 00:01:00.161
but once the time is up, shift to useful thinking.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.340
No.6 not moving your body.

00:01:02.341 --> 00:01:04.821
It lowers your energy and makes you feel sluggish.

00:01:04.822 --> 00:01:08.321
Instead, take a short walk or stretch every few hours.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.740
No.7 eating whatever's convenient instead of what's good for you.

00:01:11.741 --> 00:01:14.501
What you eat has a direct impact on your energy levels,

00:01:14.502 --> 00:01:16.221
which affects your mood, focus,

00:01:16.222 --> 00:01:18.381
and motivation. Instead,

00:01:18.382 --> 00:01:20.581
prep a few balanced meals or snacks in advance

00:01:20.582 --> 00:01:22.681
to make healthier choices easier.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.340
No.8. Overspending.

00:01:24.341 --> 00:01:27.121
It gives you short term happiness but long term stress.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.980
Instead, budget for small treats so you can enjoy them without guilt.

00:01:30.981 --> 00:01:31.701
No.. 9.

00:01:31.702 --> 00:01:33.421
Saying yes when you mean no.

00:01:33.422 --> 00:01:36.041
Doing so builds resentment and emotional fatigue.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.680
Instead, allow yourself to possibly disappoint others.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.020
It won't be the end of the world.

00:01:42.021 --> 00:01:42.661
No. 10.

00:01:42.662 --> 00:01:44.701
Ignoring your feelings. They don't go away,

00:01:44.702 --> 00:01:47.681
they build up and you become disconnected from yourself.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.880

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.220
10 little habits that worsen your mental health

00:00:02.221 --> 00:00:03.681
from a licensed therapist.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.820
No. 1 scrolling your phone first thing in the morning.

00:00:06.821 --> 00:00:10.681
It over stimulates your brain before you even get ready for the day.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.260
Instead, try connecting with a person or even a pet

00:00:14.261 --> 00:00:17.561
and wait 30 minutes before using electronic devices.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.860
No.2 staying inside all day.

00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:21.681
This causes you to feel disconnected,

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.200
sluggish, and often get more anxious.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.340
Instead, go outside,

00:00:25.341 --> 00:00:29.401
even for five minutes. Sunlight and fresh air make a real difference.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.680
No. 3 constantly watching the news.

00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:34.321
It overloads you with negativity and fear.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.720
Instead, limit news to once a day from a trusted source.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.420
No. 4 over comparing yourself to others.

00:00:40.421 --> 00:00:43.961
It distorts your reality and slowly chips away at your self esteem.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.260
Instead, limit your time on social media

00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:50.061
and use comparisons as a way to learn not to put yourself down.

00:00:50.062 --> 00:00:52.021
No. 5 constantly complaining.

00:00:52.022 --> 00:00:54.481
This traps your brain in a cycle of negativity.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.900
Instead, set a timer to vent or worry,

00:00:56.901 --> 00:01:00.161
but once the time is up, shift to useful thinking.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.340
No.6 not moving your body.

00:01:02.341 --> 00:01:04.821
It lowers your energy and makes you feel sluggish.

00:01:04.822 --> 00:01:08.321
Instead, take a short walk or stretch every few hours.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.740
No.7 eating whatever's convenient instead of what's good for you.

00:01:11.741 --> 00:01:14.501
What you eat has a direct impact on your energy levels,

00:01:14.502 --> 00:01:16.221
which affects your mood, focus,

00:01:16.222 --> 00:01:18.381
and motivation. Instead,

00:01:18.382 --> 00:01:20.581
prep a few balanced meals or snacks in advance

00:01:20.582 --> 00:01:22.681
to make healthier choices easier.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.340
No.8. Overspending.

00:01:24.341 --> 00:01:27.121
It gives you short term happiness but long term stress.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.980
Instead, budget for small treats so you can enjoy them without guilt.

00:01:30.981 --> 00:01:31.701
No.. 9.

00:01:31.702 --> 00:01:33.421
Saying yes when you mean no.

00:01:33.422 --> 00:01:36.041
Doing so builds resentment and emotional fatigue.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.680
Instead, allow yourself to possibly disappoint others.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.020
It won't be the end of the world.

00:01:42.021 --> 00:01:42.661
No. 10.

00:01:42.662 --> 00:01:44.701
Ignoring your feelings. They don't go away,

00:01:44.702 --> 00:01:47.681
they build up and you become disconnected from yourself.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.880
Instead, learn to lean into them and allow them to exist.

00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.140
Here are three signs of high functioning depression.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.220
No. 1 being numb.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.460
We can get to the point that we just don't feel.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.680
Sometimes people will say,

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.560
that's a strength.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.300
I just don't feel anything.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.760
It's not a strength.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.040
It means that our heart is overly defended

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.300
and shut down.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.200
No.2 second sign of high functioning depression

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.020
is the resignation and a hopelessness

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.400
that we just become resigned to.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.040
This is how it's going to be,

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.000
and we can function,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.800
we can perform,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.300
we can do things,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.020
but there's not a sense of hope about the future.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.520
The third sign of high functioning depression

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.500
is the coping strategies that we develop.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.300
Addictions, avoidance,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.940
distraction

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.240
that we develop.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.400
These ways of not feeling our feelings, and often

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.340
these distractions and avoidances and addictions

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.800
cause even more harm

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.020
and even more suffering in our lives.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.960

00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.720
Here are four habits that we learn

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.700
as emotionally neglected children.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.980
No. 1 people pleasing.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.480
We learn to make everyone else's needs

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.780
more important than our own

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.540
in the hope that then we will get our needs met.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.840
And so we're constantly people pleasing.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.380
We're constantly trying to keep everyone else happy.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.740
No.2 pushing through.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.080
As an emotionally neglected child,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.640
we learn that our feelings,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.400
our emotions,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.160
our experience

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.780
is really not important.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.520
So we just learn to ignore it.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.900
We learn to push through difficult experiences,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.460
and we learn to try to get away from the present

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.660
and into the future.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.740
No. 3 overthinking.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.200
When we're emotionally neglected as a child,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.780
we often find ourselves trying to think our way

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.940
to a feeling of safety.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.360
And so our mind speeds up to try and find that safety,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.140
and then we become habituated to that overthinking.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.840
No.4 we can develop controlling pattern tendencies

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.220
as a way to try to get enough sense of control

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.420
so we can feel safe.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.600

00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.580
pain travels through families until someone is ready to feel it

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:04.760
for many of us

00:00:04.761 --> 00:00:06.901
our generational curse is avoidance

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.820
we come from people who just act like it didn't happen

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.980
but pain demands to be felt

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.720
and somewhere along the line

00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:18.521
a child will be born whose charge it is to feel it all these are your shamans

00:00:18.522 --> 00:00:20.161
your priests and priestesses

00:00:20.162 --> 00:00:21.101
your healers

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.240
you call them mental health patients and label their power as depression anxiety

00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:28.181
bipolar disorder and alike

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.340
but these are the ones who are born with the gift of feeling

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.860
and as we all know

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.134

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.101
In 1954, out of 10 children had dual working parents.

00:00:03.318 --> 00:00:04.941
Today's number is 9 out of 10.

00:00:05.078 --> 00:00:06.637
The difference being in 1950,

00:00:06.638 --> 00:00:09.517
we had this very rigorous kind of system in place

00:00:09.518 --> 00:00:10.877
that dad was going to work,

00:00:10.878 --> 00:00:12.061
mom was staying home.

00:00:12.118 --> 00:00:13.397
Dad was making a paycheck,

00:00:13.398 --> 00:00:15.381
mom was running the household.

00:00:15.478 --> 00:00:17.037
In 40% of households today,

00:00:17.038 --> 00:00:18.821
mom is actually making more money than dad.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.140
In almost all households,

00:00:20.141 --> 00:00:21.697
she's doing more work at home than dad.

00:00:21.698 --> 00:00:23.737
So there's a tremendous amount of friction

00:00:23.738 --> 00:00:25.321
and frustration at home

00:00:25.578 --> 00:00:30.097
around just the actual labor and planning of the house.

00:00:30.098 --> 00:00:33.276
Right? It's so tacky and so cheesy, but it's.

00:00:33.277 --> 00:00:35.582
It's so true that if you ask most dads,

00:00:35.717 --> 00:00:36.862
who's your kids teacher?

00:00:36.917 --> 00:00:38.036
Like, they don't know the name.

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:39.516
Who's planning the vacations?

00:00:39.517 --> 00:00:40.756
Who's buying the groceries?

00:00:40.757 --> 00:00:41.836
Who's folding the clothes?

00:00:41.837 --> 00:00:44.062
Who's. You start going down this laundry list of things

00:00:44.237 --> 00:00:45.276
and almost always

00:00:45.277 --> 00:00:47.076
the answer returns back to my wife or mom,

00:00:47.077 --> 00:00:48.662
but she's also doing a 9 to 5 job.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.739
One of the first things you had to do

00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.019
when you showed up to SEAL training

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.019
was you had to swim 50m in a pool.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.939
So jump in, swim 25m to one end. 25m.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:07.479
Back story goes,

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.179
as this kid shows up,

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.240
it's his turn to swim.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:10.880
He jumped into the pool,

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.059
sinks right to the bottom

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.659
and starts walking

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.280
across the bottom of the pool to one end,

00:00:14.777 --> 00:00:15.536
walks across the bottom,

00:00:15.537 --> 00:00:16.536
pulled back to the other end,

00:00:16.537 --> 00:00:18.096
comes up, he's gasping for air,

00:00:18.097 --> 00:00:19.042
nearly drowning.

00:00:19.137 --> 00:00:20.059
The instructor looks at him, says,

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.202
what the hell are you doing?

00:00:21.657 --> 00:00:22.021
And the kid,

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.136
who's trying to still catch his breath,

00:00:23.137 --> 00:00:24.322
looks like the instructor says,

00:00:24.337 --> 00:00:25.056
I'm sorry, instructor,

00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:26.042
I don't know how to swim.

00:00:26.217 --> 00:00:27.376
And the instructor pauses for a second

00:00:27.377 --> 00:00:28.456
and looks at the kid and says,

00:00:28.457 --> 00:00:28.856
that's okay,

00:00:28.857 --> 00:00:30.442
we can teach you how to swim. Right.

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:33.056
And the whole point of that is that the instructor knew

00:00:33.057 --> 00:00:34.776
that this kid had the qualities,

00:00:34.777 --> 00:00:35.416
the attributes,

00:00:35.417 --> 00:00:36.522
whatever you want to call it,

00:00:36.855 --> 00:00:38.494
to show up to Navy SEAL training,

00:00:38.495 --> 00:00:41.054
one of the most elite maritime units on the planet,

00:00:41.055 --> 00:00:42.524
and he didn't know how to swim.

00:00:42.735 --> 00:00:44.734
He had everything inside of him that we needed

00:00:44.735 --> 00:00:45.574
for him to be a Navy SEAL.

00:00:45.575 --> 00:00:47.374
Teaching him the skill of swimming

00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:48.444
was going to be the easy part.

Hey guys, Doctor Mike my here for certified psychiatrist.

00:00:05.962 --> 00:00:08.741
Here's a question I get all the time from patients.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.040
Now, often times this comes at me in a different way.

00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:16.241
Typically it's a patient is stable on their antidepressants,

00:00:16.242 --> 00:00:19.321
settling their experiencing side effects. And voila.

00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:20.681
What's the missing link?

00:00:20.682 --> 00:00:23.541
They started smoking cannabis habitually.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.080
So what's going on here?

00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:27.661
So in cannabis,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.620
particularly the cannabidial aka CBD,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.220
that can be a potent inhibitor of an enzyme found in your liver

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.380
that helps metabolize antidepressants.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.920
So for the nerds out there,

00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:44.081
which enzyme is it?

00:00:44.082 --> 00:00:50.441
So the CBD can inhibit your 2C19 liver enzyme.

00:00:50.442 --> 00:00:54.201
And this is particularly important for metabolizing antidepressants

00:00:54.202 --> 00:00:56.301
like Zoloft and Lexapro.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.100
So what happens?

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.360
Patient stable on a Zoloft or Lexapro,

00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:02.201
they start smoking pot all the time,

00:01:02.202 --> 00:01:04.701
the metabolism reduces

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.080
and now the blood levels of the Zoloft and Lexapro go up

00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:09.761
and now they're having side effects.

00:01:09.762 --> 00:01:11.261
So what do I recommend?

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.800
Stop smoking cannabis habitually?

00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:18.741
If we want an even dose and even blood level on these antidepressants.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.480
Mind you, I have further thoughts about habitual cannabis use.

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:24.341
I can leave those in another video if you want.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.820
But that is one way the cannabis,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.180
the CBD in cannabis specifically,

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.300
can alter the blood level of antidepressants,

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.380
particularly Zoloft and Lexapro.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.660
Thank you very much.

00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.960
Doctor Mike, what are some ways you can tell the difference

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:04.721
between someone who's in a rut

00:00:04.722 --> 00:00:08.541
or burnt out versus someone who's clinically depressed?

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.500
So features of a clinical depression

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.440
that will differentiate it from someone who is in a right

00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:19.761
or someone who's burnt out.

00:00:19.762 --> 00:00:23.081
So two features come to mind. 1.

00:00:23.082 --> 00:00:25.621
Someone is clinically depressed,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.820
their mood is not reactive,

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.080
and it's independent of context.

00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:33.141
So what does that mean?

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.020
Not reactive? Mean that when someone is clinically depressed,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.400
if they get a bit of good news,

00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:43.961
their mood is not going to positively react to that.

00:00:43.962 --> 00:00:46.141
If it does, it might be for a moment.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.520
Independent of context means

00:00:48.521 --> 00:00:50.741
if you take that clinically depressed patient,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.980
you put them on a vacation in Maui,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.860
his mood will travel with him.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.060
When someone's in a rut or when someone is burnt out,

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.880
typically they get some good news,

00:01:01.881 --> 00:01:03.101
their mood will uplift.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.680
If you take them on vacation,

00:01:04.681 --> 00:01:06.221
you put them on a beach in Maui,

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.940
their mood will uplift.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.700
So these are two features that come to mind. Thank you.

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.900
Most of the people that are sitting in this room right now

00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:05.841
are walking around at about 55 or 60% of your true state of normal.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.460
And if the database that I had access to for 22 years

00:00:09.461 --> 00:00:10.801
could see the light of day,

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.000
it would permanently change the face of humanity.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.660
Unfortunately, that database never will.

00:00:16.661 --> 00:00:16.981
You see,

00:00:16.982 --> 00:00:19.981
the insurance companies are the polar opposite of Google and Facebook.

00:00:19.982 --> 00:00:22.141
They collect voluminous amounts of information,

00:00:22.142 --> 00:00:24.841
but they don't share that information back with anyone.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.740
If they did, it would upend modern medicine and healthcare

00:00:28.741 --> 00:00:30.921
in a way that would be so profound

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.400
that it would take our medical system back about 45 years.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.460
So during this time that I was a mortality researcher,

00:00:38.461 --> 00:00:39.821
which it really sounds gruesome.

00:00:39.822 --> 00:00:41.261
It kind of is. Um.

00:00:41.262 --> 00:00:43.101
But during this time that I was a mortality researcher,

00:00:43.102 --> 00:00:44.581
one of the. One of the major issues

00:00:44.582 --> 00:00:48.001
was that I was allowed to see your medical records,

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.620
all of your demographic data.

00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:50.741
I was allowed to see your.

00:00:50.742 --> 00:00:52.201
See your genetic data,

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.220
but I was not allowed to have any contact with the patient

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.241
or any contact with the treating physician.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.600
So even if I saw life threatening drug interactions,

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.760
I couldn't warn the patient.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.660
So does anyone know, just really quick,

00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:06.141
does anyone know

00:01:06.142 --> 00:01:09.921
what the third leading cause of death is in the United States?

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.920
Put your hand on medical.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.740
Medical error. That's right.

00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:17.741
So the leading cause of death is cardiovascular disease.

00:01:17.742 --> 00:01:18.661
The Second is cancer,

00:01:18.662 --> 00:01:21.121
but the third leading cause of death in this country

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.480
is modern medicine.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
If we got five years of medical records on you

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.840
and five years of demographic data,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.200
we could tell the insurance company how long you had to live

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.440
to the month.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.580
And this is some of the most accurate research in the world,

00:00:13.581 --> 00:00:16.101
because the database that insurance companies have,

00:00:16.102 --> 00:00:18.641
which is the largest population database in the world,

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.720
has 360 million lives,

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.480
contains information that no other database on the planet has.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.300
No wellness franchise has this.

00:00:27.301 --> 00:00:30.261
No clinical study ever published in Modern Medicine has this.

00:00:30.262 --> 00:00:32.101
No physician's office has this.

00:00:32.102 --> 00:00:33.461
The National Library of medicine,

00:00:33.462 --> 00:00:35.921
the National Institute of health don't have this information.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.980
They have the day, the date,

00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:39.301
the time, the location,

00:00:39.302 --> 00:00:40.761
and the cause of death

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.900
for every person that ever took out a life insurance policy

00:00:43.901 --> 00:00:45.281
that they paid a death claim on.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.260
And 360 million times, they trace that information back

00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:52.481
to the specifics that occurred in their life.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.360
They shorten their health span,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.920
they shorten their lifespan,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.360
and LED to some of the most common ailments

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.240
that most people in this room are suffering from right now.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.140
I'm not talking about pathology and disease.

00:01:03.141 --> 00:01:05.701
I'm talking about things that we don't take for granted.

00:01:05.702 --> 00:01:08.581
Things like clean, clear waking energy,

00:01:08.582 --> 00:01:10.201
healthy cognitive function,

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.020
a poor response to exercise,

00:01:12.021 --> 00:01:13.661
the depth of our delta wave of sleep,

00:01:13.662 --> 00:01:15.721
our water retention, our hormone balance,

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.740
our waking energy. These things that we have accepted as.

00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:23.721
As society and humanity, as a natural consequence of aging.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.168
Have you ever had an MRI scan of your brain

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:03.648
and it came back completely normal?

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:05.008
But you have a whole bunch of weird

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.288
neurological symptoms going on

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:07.768
that no doctor can explain?

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:08.349
Keep watching.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.328
Cause allow me to explain what's happening in your body.

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:10.764
So right now,

00:00:10.765 --> 00:00:11.888
what I wanna show you right here

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.090
is an MRI scan of someone's brain.

00:00:14.185 --> 00:00:15.344
What you can see here,

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:16.464
these green arrows,

00:00:16.465 --> 00:00:18.664
those are what we call white matter lesions.

00:00:18.665 --> 00:00:20.064
Now, if you look at this MRI scan,

00:00:20.065 --> 00:00:20.944
you can see that this person

00:00:20.945 --> 00:00:22.759
has a lot of white matter lesions.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.264
So what exactly are white matter lesions?

00:00:25.265 --> 00:00:28.274
White matter lesions are dead brain cells.

00:00:28.383 --> 00:00:30.702
Let me bring your attention to this right here

00:00:30.703 --> 00:00:33.262
on what Google says about white matter lesions.

00:00:33.263 --> 00:00:35.102
So it says some white matter lesions

00:00:35.103 --> 00:00:37.382
may not cause noticeable symptoms

00:00:37.383 --> 00:00:40.099
and can be considered almost normal with aging.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.660
I want to let you know

00:00:40.661 --> 00:00:42.862
if you have white matter lesions in your MRI scan,

00:00:42.863 --> 00:00:44.979
this is not normal at all.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.306
I don't care what age you're at.

00:00:46.307 --> 00:00:49.051
This is literally dead nerve tissue in your brain.

00:00:49.052 --> 00:00:50.119
Now, down below here

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.895
in the highlighting,

00:00:50.896 --> 00:00:52.047
it says, however,

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:55.411
some of these lesions can damage important pathways,

00:00:55.412 --> 00:00:57.091
highways within your brain

00:00:57.092 --> 00:00:59.291
and cause problems such as memory problems

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:00.188
and balance problems

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:01.103
and walking problems.

00:01:01.104 --> 00:01:03.228
If you've ever had an MRI scan of your brain

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:04.708
and it says white matter lesions,

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:05.748
a normal finding,

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:07.108
this is not normal.

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:09.668
This means that your Brain is literally inflamed

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:10.748
and right this second

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:13.028
your brain cell tissues are dying.

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:14.468

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.314
Have you ever taken coconut oil?

00:00:01.315 --> 00:00:02.634
You're gonna wanna watch this video.

00:00:02.635 --> 00:00:03.434
Allow me to explain.

00:00:03.435 --> 00:00:04.339
When clients come to me,

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.234
I like them to take caprylic acid.

00:00:06.235 --> 00:00:08.519
A lot of people say caprylic acid isn't coconut oil,

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.874
so I can just take coconut oil.

00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:11.794
And there is truth to that. Here's the.

00:00:11.795 --> 00:00:15.064
In order for you to get one tablespoon of caprylic acid,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.262
do we need to consume 14 tablespoons of Coconut Oil?

00:00:19.263 --> 00:00:19.815
Why is that?

00:00:19.816 --> 00:00:23.742
Because only 7% of coconut oil is caprylic acid.

00:00:23.743 --> 00:00:24.975
So this is what I wanna show you right here.

00:00:24.976 --> 00:00:26.055
This is what I recommend.

00:00:26.056 --> 00:00:28.259
This is called Bulletproof Brain acting.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.076
Now you can see down here specifically is C 8.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.129
So instead of taking 14 tablespoons of coconut oil,

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.289
you can take one tablespoon of this caprylic acid

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.569
and you get all the benefits of caprylic acid.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.948
So what are the benefits?

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:43.489
There's 4 critical benefits of caprylic acid.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.249
One is it's anti microbial.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.199
Basically, it's gonna kill Candida, viruses and bugs.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.509
Number 2, it's anti inflammatory.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.589
Number 3, it helps brain degeneration.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.469
And 4, caprylic acid is needed for the fuel source

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.719
for mitochondria.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.208
So what I recommend my clients do,

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:02.479
some clients will take 1 2 or 3 tablespoons.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.138
Tablespoons?

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:05.578
Yes, tablespoons per day of caprylic acid.

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:07.858
So if they take 3 tablespoons of caprylic acid,

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:09.578
they literally have to take

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:12.179
45 tablespoons of coconut oil every single day.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.098
This is why I recommend caprylic acid.

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:15.338

00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.800
Hi, I'm this is Z from Glego hospital calling for today.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.480
I'm going to show you what you should do when

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.440
having no split.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.880
So when during no split,

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.480
the most common reaction is to kill the head backward.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.220
And this is the not correct way.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.060
So why this is not a correct way?

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.760
Because when you kill your head backward,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.200
the blood flow will go backward.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.560
So the correct way will be

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.500
lean and kill your head forward.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.420
Gently pinch over your nose

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.680
and put a core compression over your forehead

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.060
at least 5 minutes.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.560
Then to reassess the bleeding.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.000
If the bleeding doesn't stop,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.720
you have to go to a nearest hospital immediately.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.960
So if you find this Texas helpful,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.620

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.300
Goodnight.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.919
Standard universal sign for choking is

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.199
cross the hand at the neck level.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.879
If you notice someone do like this,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.759
that means they're having choking.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.879
The tips of choking.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.999
Ask the patient,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.519
are they able to cough and breathe?

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.700
If they say yes,

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.519
do not attempt to do helmets reviewer

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.039
like them or encourage them to puff out spontaneously.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.439
If they say they can,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.199
let's proceed.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.679
For helmets reviewer.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.879
Okay to do helmets reviewer.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.519
Then at the back of the patient

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.079
and show patient is steady.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.540
Look directly at the head of the patient.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.140
Do your hand fist.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.479
Look for patients.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.519
They will button.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.439
Put under the rib cage.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.639
1, 2, 7. Charlie,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.399
are you okay?

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.119
So if Charlie says okay,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.620
that means your maneuver is successful.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.479
So I hope whatever I got you will be useful.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.399

00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.799
if you can't stop thinking and fantasizing

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.359
about someone

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.239
I'm a therapist

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.799
here's why and what you can do

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.599
your obsession is serving a function for you

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.079
so it's not actually about them

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.519
maybe you're obsessed when you feel lonely

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.479
so you think about them more

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.540
when you feel alone

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.599
so every time you catch yourself obsessing

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.359
use it as a clue

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.559
that you're avoiding your feelings

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.940
and you have an unmet need

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.359
try to sit with what's coming up

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.279
and then give yourself

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.759
permission to feel the loneliness

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.340
and then fill the need yourself

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.239
if you repeat this

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.799
and get used to connecting to the loneliness

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.239
you'll soon stop obsessing about them

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.599

He is coming out onto the balcony of Saint Peter's behind me.

00:00:04.181 --> 00:00:08.561
Now, that is the spot where the Pope gives the Urbi et Orbi blessing

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.540
on Easter Sunday and Christmas Day.

00:00:10.541 --> 00:00:13.501
It's also the spot where he appeared for the first time

00:00:13.502 --> 00:00:17.101
when he was elected in 2,013.

00:00:17.102 --> 00:00:21.401
Now, Francis is not able to speak for a long time

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.300
because of the pneumonia that he has experienced

00:00:25.301 --> 00:00:27.001
and has been suffering from.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.180
He is going through physiotherapy every day

00:00:29.181 --> 00:00:31.001
to try and regain his voice.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.860
But he has been shown a determination to try and get out and about

00:00:35.861 --> 00:00:37.301
to meet, uh,

00:00:37.302 --> 00:00:38.861
people. He, uh,

00:00:38.862 --> 00:00:42.461
over the Easter weekend, on Thursday before, uh,

00:00:42.462 --> 00:00:44.181
Easter, he went to prison.

00:00:44.182 --> 00:00:46.061
They met with inmates. Saturday night,

00:00:46.062 --> 00:00:47.981
last night, he was out in the, uh,

00:00:47.982 --> 00:00:50.421
basilica. He greeted pilgrims there.

00:00:50.422 --> 00:00:53.021
And as we can see, he is now, uh,

00:00:53.022 --> 00:00:56.101
in Saint Peter's to offer that blessing.

00:00:56.102 --> 00:00:57.701
For at Easter Sunday,

00:00:57.702 --> 00:01:00.661
we're just listening to the Vatican national anthem,

00:01:00.662 --> 00:01:05.181
and then we are going to hopefully hear something from the pope.

00:01:05.182 --> 00:01:06.821
Now, on Easter Sunday,

00:01:06.822 --> 00:01:09.921
the pope normally gives a longer reflection,

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.920
sort of state of the world address,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.180
where he addresses different conflicts across the world

00:01:15.181 --> 00:01:16.561
and appeals for peace.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.340
Traditionally. Now,

00:01:18.341 --> 00:01:22.101
we're not expecting the pope to deliver a long address,

00:01:22.102 --> 00:01:27.601
that long address, but the Vatican are expected to release that text.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.980
What we are expecting the Pope to do

00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:32.041
is actually offer the blessing himself.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.820
The words of blessing, which Include an indulgence,

00:01:35.821 --> 00:01:40.101
which for Catholics is the remission from the punishment of sins.

00:01:40.102 --> 00:01:42.301
It is offered on Easter Sunday.

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:43.961
I'm just checking behind me here.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.740
He is definitely up, up there.

00:01:45.741 --> 00:01:50.461
And he will be preparing to give that blessing now.

00:01:50.462 --> 00:01:54.141
It's not clear whether there will be another aid or cardinal

00:01:54.142 --> 00:01:55.821
to read the address of the pope.

00:01:55.822 --> 00:01:57.801
Perhaps the pope will just give the blessing

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.300
and we'll have to wait and see.

00:01:59.301 --> 00:02:02.321
There's a lot of expectation here in the square.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.380

00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.800
bpd is the experience of feeling more

00:00:02.801 --> 00:00:06.280
thinking faster and acting faster than other people

00:00:06.281 --> 00:00:09.240
and having that be the way your brain and body function

00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:13.560
in an environment while growing up that could not meet you where you were at

00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:16.120
whether it was abusive invalidating

00:00:16.121 --> 00:00:19.800

and when you feel that deeply

00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:29.400
and there is no one around you that is capable of holding it yeah

00:00:29.401 --> 00:00:31.600
borderline personality disorder can develop

00:00:31.601 --> 00:00:32.759
I don't even like the name of it

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.400
but I use it because it's the name that people search for

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:38.280
when they're trying to find answers to reasons why their pain

00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:40.040
and their feelings are so big

00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:44.960
and their relationships feel this hard when they feel like too much too often

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.520
for too many people that's what bpd is

00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:49.980
it's the fear that when you feel

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.360
people will leave and if that's what you Learned

00:00:52.361 --> 00:00:54.640
of course abandonment scares you

00:00:54.641 --> 00:00:57.160
of course your identity feels unstable

00:00:57.161 --> 00:00:59.880
your reflection was rejection

00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:03.040
and rejection doesn't give you a self to hold on to

00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:03.760
so yeah

00:01:03.761 --> 00:01:06.160
the symptoms make sense the mood swings

00:01:06.161 --> 00:01:07.800
the rage the sadness

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:09.840
it's honestly not about being too much

00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:12.924
it's about being left alone with too much for too long

00:01:12.925 --> 00:01:15.660

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.420
The fifth symptom of BPD, recurrent suicidal behaviour, gestures,

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:07.781
threats or self harm, is one of the most misunderstood

00:00:07.782 --> 00:00:10.581
criteria of borderline personality disorder.

00:00:10.582 --> 00:00:13.941
Around 50% of people with BPD engage in self harm.

00:00:13.942 --> 00:00:16.361
And it's not always about wanting to die.

00:00:16.362 --> 00:00:18.021
Can be a way to regulate emotions,

00:00:18.022 --> 00:00:20.021
to feel real when nothing else does,

00:00:20.022 --> 00:00:22.221
to feel something when you're feeling nothing.

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:24.901
And it's often linked to feelings of emptiness

00:00:24.902 --> 00:00:29.141
and the need to control when the emotions feel so out of control.

00:00:29.142 --> 00:00:33.241
People with B P D. May experience sensory processing differently,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.020
so the pain that they cause to themselves

00:00:36.021 --> 00:00:38.921
may feel different than the pain caused by others,

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.720
therefore controlling the pain and at times masking it.

00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:46.301
Some people with BPD have a larger emotional

00:00:46.302 --> 00:00:50.101
amygdala response to negative things happening in their life.

00:00:50.102 --> 00:00:53.461
So just like almost everything else with a human condition,

00:00:53.462 --> 00:00:56.181
these symptoms live on a spectrum.

00:00:56.182 --> 00:01:00.181
Now, chronic HE is very common in BPD,

00:01:00.182 --> 00:01:03.541
and it can be hard to determine when an attempt will be made.

00:01:03.542 --> 00:01:08.701
In BPD, suicidality can become a chronic way to manage life

00:01:08.702 --> 00:01:10.941
versus be an acute situation.

00:01:10.942 --> 00:01:13.241
And at the same time,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.500
up to 10% of people with BPD end up taking their life.

00:01:17.501 --> 00:01:21.501
It's really important to remember that not all people with BPD

00:01:21.502 --> 00:01:23.421
will experience suicidality

00:01:23.422 --> 00:01:26.701
or self harm. The diagnosis of BPD

00:01:26.702 --> 00:01:30.421
and the way the person's brain and body function can go

00:01:30.422 --> 00:01:33.301
missed if you're only looking for this criteria.

00:01:33.302 --> 00:01:35.781
If you are Someone that experiences BPD

00:01:35.782 --> 00:01:37.781
and you are engaging in self harm

00:01:37.782 --> 00:01:39.601
or you are feeling suicidal,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.580

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360
What would happen if you took magnesium for two weeks?

00:00:02.361 --> 00:00:05.041
You have to realize that a huge percent of the population

00:00:05.042 --> 00:00:06.721
is deficient in magnesium.

00:00:06.722 --> 00:00:09.441
Unfortunately, you can't accurately test magnesium in the blood

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:11.881
since only 1% of it is in the blood.

00:00:11.882 --> 00:00:13.081
But if you took magnesium,

00:00:13.082 --> 00:00:15.481
your anxiety would start going away.

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:18.001
You would feel calmer. You would sleep a lot better.

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:21.481
All those muscle spasms, leg cramps will go away.

00:00:21.482 --> 00:00:25.161
And if you had any heart problems like high blood pressure, arrhythmias,

00:00:25.162 --> 00:00:26.801
you would find that those will start clearing up.

00:00:26.802 --> 00:00:30.201
The best magnesium retake is something called magnesium glycinate.

00:00:30.202 --> 00:00:33.801
This is the type that won't cause diarrhea but will help you sleep.

00:00:33.802 --> 00:00:37.881
Take between 400 and 800 mg in the evening before sleep.

He is coming out onto the balcony of Saint Peter's behind me.

00:00:04.181 --> 00:00:08.561
Now, that is the spot where the Pope gives the Urbi et Orbi blessing

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.540
on Easter Sunday and Christmas Day.

00:00:10.541 --> 00:00:13.501
It's also the spot where he appeared for the first time

00:00:13.502 --> 00:00:17.101
when he was elected in 2,013.

00:00:17.102 --> 00:00:21.401
Now, Francis is not able to speak for a long time

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.300
because of the pneumonia that he has experienced

00:00:25.301 --> 00:00:27.001
and has been suffering from.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.180
He is going through physiotherapy every day

00:00:29.181 --> 00:00:31.001
to try and regain his voice.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.860
But he has been shown a determination to try and get out and about

00:00:35.861 --> 00:00:37.301
to meet, uh,

00:00:37.302 --> 00:00:38.861
people. He, uh,

00:00:38.862 --> 00:00:42.461
over the Easter weekend, on Thursday before, uh,

00:00:42.462 --> 00:00:44.181
Easter, he went to prison.

00:00:44.182 --> 00:00:46.061
They met with inmates. Saturday night,

00:00:46.062 --> 00:00:47.981
last night, he was out in the, uh,

00:00:47.982 --> 00:00:50.421
basilica. He greeted pilgrims there.

00:00:50.422 --> 00:00:53.021
And as we can see, he is now, uh,

00:00:53.022 --> 00:00:56.101
in Saint Peter's to offer that blessing.

00:00:56.102 --> 00:00:57.701
For at Easter Sunday,

00:00:57.702 --> 00:01:00.661
we're just listening to the Vatican national anthem,

00:01:00.662 --> 00:01:05.181
and then we are going to hopefully hear something from the pope.

00:01:05.182 --> 00:01:06.821
Now, on Easter Sunday,

00:01:06.822 --> 00:01:09.921
the pope normally gives a longer reflection,

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.920
sort of state of the world address,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.180
where he addresses different conflicts across the world

00:01:15.181 --> 00:01:16.561
and appeals for peace.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.340
Traditionally. Now,

00:01:18.341 --> 00:01:22.101
we're not expecting the pope to deliver a long address,

00:01:22.102 --> 00:01:27.601
that long address, but the Vatican are expected to release that text.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.980
What we are expecting the Pope to do

00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:32.041
is actually offer the blessing himself.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.820
The words of blessing, which Include an indulgence,

00:01:35.821 --> 00:01:40.101
which for Catholics is the remission from the punishment of sins.

00:01:40.102 --> 00:01:42.301
It is offered on Easter Sunday.

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:43.961
I'm just checking behind me here.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.740
He is definitely up, up there.

00:01:45.741 --> 00:01:50.461
And he will be preparing to give that blessing now.

00:01:50.462 --> 00:01:54.141
It's not clear whether there will be another aid or cardinal

00:01:54.142 --> 00:01:55.821
to read the address of the pope.

00:01:55.822 --> 00:01:57.801
Perhaps the pope will just give the blessing

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.300
and we'll have to wait and see.

00:01:59.301 --> 00:02:02.321
There's a lot of expectation here in the square.

3. Things that you may be doing

00:00:01.832 --> 00:00:03.511
that are driving yourself crazy.

00:00:03.512 --> 00:00:05.151
They're actually thinking styles

00:00:05.152 --> 00:00:07.947
that are known to lead to depression and anxiety.

00:00:08.032 --> 00:00:09.551
Or maybe just feeling more worried

00:00:09.552 --> 00:00:11.027
or down than you need to.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.775
The first one.

00:00:11.776 --> 00:00:13.706
We're going to talk about all or none thinking.

00:00:13.707 --> 00:00:15.426
You see things in absolutes,

00:00:15.427 --> 00:00:16.472
black and white.

00:00:16.627 --> 00:00:17.586

00:00:17.587 --> 00:00:18.466

This is perfect,

00:00:19.267 --> 00:00:20.312
this is terrible.

00:00:20.507 --> 00:00:22.506
Most things in life are on a continuum.

00:00:22.507 --> 00:00:26.192
And if you can rate things from on a scale 0-10,

00:00:26.387 --> 00:00:28.626
you'll see things a little more realistically

00:00:28.627 --> 00:00:30.392
and maybe not as upsetting.

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:31.349

00:00:34.529 --> 00:00:37.648

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:48.948
Jumping to conclusions without any evidence.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.068

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:56.110

as soon as that person falls short on something,

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.079
seeing them as totally bad.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.900
Rapid changes in self identity and self image,

sometimes even shifting their goals,

reviewing themselves as bad,

or sometimes even feeling as if they don't exist at all.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.839
Periods of paranoia

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.239
that seem to be related to being stressed

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.439
and a loss of contact with reality,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.839
which can last from a few minutes to a few hours.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.279
Impulsive and risky behaviors

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.319
that are fun in the moment

binge eating, drug abuse

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.679
or even sabotaging success by quitting a good job

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.759
or ending a positive relationship.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.199
Suicidal threats or suicidal behavior

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.700
or even self injury,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.599
often in response to the person

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.799
fearing separation or abandonment.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.639
Wide mood swings.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.679
It can last from a few hours to a few days

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.479
and can include intense happiness or irritability

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.220
or shame or anxiety.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.879
Ongoing feelings of emptiness.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.719
And here's the kicker

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.519
inappropriate

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.439
intense anger,

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.959
such as losing their temper,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.999
or even getting involved in physical fights.

If you or someone you know is exhibiting a lot of these

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.879
Signs a lot of the time.

sometimes my adhd

00:00:00.884 --> 00:00:02.035
can make a really hard to do things

00:00:02.204 --> 00:00:04.115
like brushing my teeth at night. I never brush my teeth at night

00:00:04.164 --> 00:00:07.075
so then I don't brush my teeth even though all day I tell myself to do it

00:00:07.444 --> 00:00:08.555
so then don't brush your teeth at night

00:00:08.684 --> 00:00:10.035
do when you think of it during the day

00:00:11.097 --> 00:00:12.182
But your brush your teeth at night

00:00:12.457 --> 00:00:13.382
Right! thatâd be ideal

00:00:13.457 --> 00:00:15.702
but with your brain and how it works that's not working for you

00:00:16.897 --> 00:00:17.622
so what do I do

00:00:17.977 --> 00:00:18.782
let's work with your brain

00:00:18.857 --> 00:00:21.022
so if it's 4:00pm and you're in the bathroom and you think to brush your teeth

00:00:21.137 --> 00:00:21.782
brush those teeth

00:00:21.782 --> 00:00:23.299
it's better you do it then then not at all!

00:00:23.299 --> 00:00:24.182
 I guess that makes sense

00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.540
In the beginning was the word.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.120
Christ is a master at using short,

00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:10.341
mysterious stories. They change the listener who takes them seriously.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.920
My experience with the biblical text is that there

00:00:14.921 --> 00:00:16.521
inexhaustible sources of wisdom.

00:00:16.522 --> 00:00:18.761
If I find something in them that is an obstacle,

00:00:18.762 --> 00:00:22.001
it's because there's something in me that has yet to be transformed.

00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:23.901
I just don't get it.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.400
The person that you do not think could ever be virtuous,

00:00:27.401 --> 00:00:28.641
oh, let me show you.

00:00:28.642 --> 00:00:30.961
This is the person who is fulfilling the law in the prophets,

00:00:30.962 --> 00:00:33.941
but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.520
and all these things shall be added to you as well.

00:00:36.521 --> 00:00:37.681
I don't believe in that promise.

00:00:37.682 --> 00:00:39.081
I'll just be honest at this point.

00:00:39.082 --> 00:00:41.381
That has not been part of my experience.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.880
Terrible. I've been trying to understand forever.

00:00:43.881 --> 00:00:45.881
While we were talking and while we were sitting there,

00:00:45.882 --> 00:00:47.641
then it hit me. I saw it.

00:00:47.642 --> 00:00:51.681
Name me one ideology that has supplanted Christianity

00:00:51.682 --> 00:00:53.841
that has done good for humanity.

00:00:53.842 --> 00:00:58.041
This Jew is very frightened of the post Christian society.

00:00:58.042 --> 00:00:59.601
He was the god man, the model,

00:00:59.602 --> 00:01:03.201
the example of what we ought to become and what we can become.

00:01:03.202 --> 00:01:05.361
It's okay. It's safe for you

00:01:05.362 --> 00:01:08.281
and all of your doubts and apprehensions to open up

00:01:08.282 --> 00:01:09.961
and to let these stories in.

00:01:09.962 --> 00:01:11.881
He is the temple. He is the Torah,

00:01:11.882 --> 00:01:14.921
he is the covenant. He is prophecy fulfilled.

00:01:14.922 --> 00:01:18.441
If you're doing this and it isn't also the love of wisdom,

00:01:18.442 --> 00:01:19.881
it's Also, an attempt at wisdom.

00:01:19.882 --> 00:01:21.081
Without love in both ways,

00:01:21.082 --> 00:01:22.401
you're going erratically wrong.

00:01:22.402 --> 00:01:25.381
Power of love. It sounds so cliche when you say it.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.200
I don't wanna be in a hallmark card.

00:01:27.201 --> 00:01:28.221
I tell you,

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.060
we've got our work cut out for us, gentlemen.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.640
This is one peculiar time and one peculiar text,

00:01:34.641 --> 00:01:37.141
and I sure hope for up to the task.

00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.500
Why did I decide to build an online university?

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.100
Well,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.720
there is a crisis now in higher education.

00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:12.641
The president of Harvard University resign today.

00:00:12.642 --> 00:00:17.781
We just calling for the genocide of Jews violate pens code of conduct.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.880
We have a problem of affordability and cost spiraling student loans.

00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:23.881
We have a group think emerging

00:00:23.882 --> 00:00:26.981
and that warps the entire academic enterprise.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.120
I experimented with putting my lectures online

00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:34.241
and found that I could teach far more people at very low cost

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:35.861
than I could at the university.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.860
And I thought, well, why not scale that?

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.100
What I'm hoping to do is to find the best lectures in the world

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.160
and to bring them to as wide as possible an audience.

00:00:51.161 --> 00:00:52.601
He came to me and he basically said,

00:00:52.602 --> 00:00:56.481
I want you to do the best course that you've always wanted to do.

00:00:56.482 --> 00:00:59.701
We wanna bring you the highest quality education possible

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.280
at the lowest possible price.

00:01:01.281 --> 00:01:02.841
It's extremely high level content

00:01:02.842 --> 00:01:04.881
that anybody can use to educate themselves

00:01:04.882 --> 00:01:06.541
and it's available to everybody.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.860
Well, that would be good.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.600
I think it's funny cause I got cancelled at the university

00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:14.501
so I could try to return the favor.

00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.500
The mother who hurt you is not gonna be the mother who heals you.

00:00:03.501 --> 00:00:07.221
So many of us reopen our wounds when we keep going to our mother

00:00:07.222 --> 00:00:08.621
expecting her to change

00:00:08.622 --> 00:00:11.421
or to love us in the way that we've always wanted to be loved.

00:00:11.422 --> 00:00:14.141
So if your mother has showed you that she doesn't wanna do the work,

00:00:14.142 --> 00:00:17.621
then she's not going to. If she said things like, sorry,

00:00:17.622 --> 00:00:18.941
I'm a terrible mother, or,

00:00:18.942 --> 00:00:20.421
I guess everything is my fault,

00:00:20.422 --> 00:00:22.861
then what she's telling you is that emotionally,

00:00:22.862 --> 00:00:24.581
she's still very young. Now,

00:00:24.582 --> 00:00:27.261
you can absolutely still have a relationship with her.

00:00:27.262 --> 00:00:29.141
This isn't about cutting her off.

00:00:29.142 --> 00:00:32.401
This is about you learning to manage your own expectations.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.160
Your healing process is to become the mother you never had.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.100
You always needed an advocate,

00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:40.461
a protector, and someone to comfort you.

00:00:40.462 --> 00:00:42.801
And now it's your work to give that to yourself.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.580
Your mother might be 50 or 60 years old,

00:00:45.581 --> 00:00:48.281
but emotionally, she's 7 or 10 years old.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.020
And knowing that, you're responsible for what information you give her

00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:53.381
and how you interact with her.

00:00:53.382 --> 00:00:56.061
You can't expect a seven year old to support you.

00:00:56.062 --> 00:00:57.581
And you can't expect a ten year old

00:00:57.582 --> 00:00:59.181
to be able to understand your emotion,

00:00:59.182 --> 00:01:00.861
know what she's capable of giving,

00:01:00.862 --> 00:01:02.854
and protect yourself and your heart.

00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.140
When you grow up with an absent father,

00:00:02.141 --> 00:00:05.181
and I'm also talking about a father that's in the home

00:00:05.182 --> 00:00:07.661
but emotionally unavailable or shut down,

00:00:07.662 --> 00:00:12.021
there's a trauma, a huge hole left within us that we carry around.

00:00:12.022 --> 00:00:13.901
We start to believe that we weren't good enough

00:00:13.902 --> 00:00:16.081
or lovable enough to have him stay.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.260
And this is where eating disorders and addictions can develop.

00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:21.361
Because even though they're destructive,

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.620
it's finally something that we can control.

00:00:23.621 --> 00:00:25.341
We couldn't control losing him,

00:00:25.342 --> 00:00:26.941
but we can control our weight,

00:00:26.942 --> 00:00:29.781
our food intake, and when we use substances.

00:00:29.782 --> 00:00:33.261
As we get older, having an absent father shows up in our relationships

00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:34.681
because we can't relax.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.660
We have this constant voice in our head that says

00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:37.861
we're gonna be abandoned.

00:00:37.862 --> 00:00:41.301
Or we have walls up so high that no one can really get in.

00:00:41.302 --> 00:00:44.061
Sometimes our body speaks the grief that we've experienced

00:00:44.062 --> 00:00:45.261
through an autoimmune disorder

00:00:45.262 --> 00:00:48.181
or other mystery illness. Because the truth is,

00:00:48.182 --> 00:00:50.181
fathers really are important.

00:00:50.182 --> 00:00:53.221
We have a culture that's really reduced a father's responsibility

00:00:53.222 --> 00:00:57.441
to just providing. A father's love and consistency

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.460
shapes our health and the future of our relationships.

00:01:00.461 --> 00:01:03.501
This is a gentle call for men to be accountable parents

00:01:03.502 --> 00:01:06.401
and to stop running from themselves and their families.

In the days before Hurricane,

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.080
a hammer and nails

00:00:03.081 --> 00:00:07.381
are exactly the tools you need to arm yourself for what lies ahead.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.320
But when that storm hits, the last thing you need to hear

00:00:11.321 --> 00:00:14.701

In those moments,

00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:20.401

and bring the words that we need to hear right now.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.680
But the truth is, many of us find ourselves alone

00:00:26.681 --> 00:00:29.301
without that person to study ourselves on.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.360
You might say that everything I bought you so far

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.320
But this book open.

00:00:39.321 --> 00:00:44.841
When is my hand reaching out to yours in the eye of the storm, saying,

from those electronics that are constantly flooding your central nervous system

00:00:51.592 --> 00:00:54.947
with a steady little stream to keep your brain hyper focused

00:00:55.072 --> 00:00:56.947
on looking for the next little piece

00:00:56.992 --> 00:01:00.031
the more we learn to disconnect and use the tool for what it is

00:01:00.032 --> 00:01:02.191
the more we can connect to ourselves meaningfully

00:01:02.192 --> 00:01:03.439
as well as those around us

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.167
to again improve that vigil test

00:01:05.168 --> 00:01:06.287
3rd get outside

00:01:06.288 --> 00:01:07.767
especially in the sunshine

00:01:07.768 --> 00:01:10.807
this helps our body access as much vitamin d as possible

00:01:10.808 --> 00:01:13.651
an essential ingredient to building serotonin

00:01:13.728 --> 00:01:17.687
this is the active neurotransmitter targeted in ssri's

00:01:17.688 --> 00:01:19.811
the most popularly used antidepressant

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.730
4th spend time with those loved ones

00:01:21.731 --> 00:01:23.570
and even cuddling with pets

00:01:23.571 --> 00:01:25.970
this releases oxytocin in our brain

00:01:25.971 --> 00:01:27.787
which decreases levels of stress

00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:29.250
hormone and cortisol

00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:32.490
which helps us access the parasympathetic nervous system again

00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:33.330
improving rest

00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:35.410
recover and digest for our body

00:01:35.411 --> 00:01:37.010
5th go find some flow states

00:01:37.011 --> 00:01:38.248
and lose yourself

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.235
these are activities that you have to be 110% dialed in on

00:01:42.236 --> 00:01:43.223
and if you're not

00:01:43.276 --> 00:01:44.463
you fail miserably

00:01:44.596 --> 00:01:46.099
but the more that you learn how to do it

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.119
the more that you learn to appreciate it

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.109
this helps you get out of your head when you're in a more hyper arousal

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.829
anxiety fixated place

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.149
and quicker to distract yourself cognitively and emotionally

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.768
this also serves to regulate your physical self

00:01:58.769 --> 00:02:00.909
because if you get too excited in that state

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:01.789
it doesn't work

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.269
for focusing on what your brain is attuned to

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.759
6 learn more about gut health

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.887
so you can minimize inflammation throughout your whole body

00:02:09.012 --> 00:02:10.371
inflammation is most

00:02:10.372 --> 00:02:13.607
impacted on cells that are the greatest conductors of electricity

00:02:13.692 --> 00:02:15.811
your brain is 70% fat

00:02:15.812 --> 00:02:18.931
so if that knee or gut is swollen and bloated

00:02:18.932 --> 00:02:20.691
imagine what your brain looks like

00:02:20.692 --> 00:02:23.639
Devon develop a spiritual practice that works for you

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.549
even if it is considered more atheist

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.389
and considering yourself an organic

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.608
biological organism that lives within a system of Gaian

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.349
it's your responsibility to be a Good Shepherd leader

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.349
to help look out for the earth

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.589
and serve meaningfully

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.549
it's all about being connected to what we are doing

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.469
moment to moment

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.949
every day so we can go to bed good tired

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.749
knowing that we've done what we can when we can

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.989
to be of service to our loved ones

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.688
so that we get

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:49.669
breathe back into

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.989
this is what human beings are programmed for

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.069
at the end of the day

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.749
and that ain't never going out of fashion

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
In healthcare, if you smoke cigarettes for 20 years and you get cancer,

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.800
do you you are now hiking from the pool?

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.380
I've been practicing hospital medicine for over 10 years,

00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:15.701
and not once have I ever taken into account

00:00:15.702 --> 00:00:17.841
somebody's personal lifestyle choices

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.980
when determining whether or not they are deserving of treatment.

00:00:20.981 --> 00:00:22.861
An example of this is with pancreatitis.

00:00:22.862 --> 00:00:24.501
I see this all the time in the hospital.

00:00:24.502 --> 00:00:26.701
Half the time it's from an impacted gallstone.

00:00:26.702 --> 00:00:29.421
The other half of the time it's from a heavy alcohol use.

00:00:29.422 --> 00:00:31.861
I don't go up to the people who have been drinking and say, oh,

00:00:31.862 --> 00:00:34.401
you did this to yourself. You're less of a priority.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.740
Of course, not everybody gets treated the same.

00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:40.801
And honestly, this idea about people bringing disease upon themselves.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.660
You could say that about a lot of things, right?

00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:43.901
Like when I'm skateboarding,

00:00:43.902 --> 00:00:45.581
if I fall and break my wrist,

00:00:45.582 --> 00:00:46.701
you could say I deserved it

00:00:46.702 --> 00:00:50.981
by trying to do 1980 style freestyle skateboarding in 2,025.

00:00:50.982 --> 00:00:54.001
But I don't think that makes me any less deserving of healthcare.

00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:56.461
So I just wanted to make this video to say that

00:00:56.462 --> 00:00:58.261
while doctors will try to guide you

00:00:58.262 --> 00:01:00.121
and to make healthy lifestyle choices,

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.660
we're not going to blame you or hold it against you

00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:04.341
if you end up with a disease

00:01:04.342 --> 00:01:07.601
that could be blamed on a unhealthy lifestyle choice.

00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.820
Okay, guys,

00:00:00.821 --> 00:00:04.001
quick, what is going on with this EKG?

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.420
If you said that it's normal,

00:00:05.421 --> 00:00:07.261
you would sort of be correct

00:00:07.262 --> 00:00:08.141
in the sense that

00:00:08.142 --> 00:00:12.301
doctors don't typically do anything special for EKG's. This.

00:00:12.302 --> 00:00:15.621
But technically, this is not a normal EKG.

00:00:15.622 --> 00:00:18.721
It is a first degree atrioventricular block.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.620
Check out the P wave. Now look at the QRS.

00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:24.261
Look at the PR interval. It's greater than 200 milliseconds.

00:00:24.262 --> 00:00:27.741
This is prolonged. This can be caused by many different things,

00:00:27.742 --> 00:00:29.701
including electrolyte abnormalities

00:00:29.702 --> 00:00:31.141
or a side effect of medications

00:00:31.142 --> 00:00:34.321
like beta blockers or Calcium channel blockers.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.100
A doctor's job is to try to ascertain

00:00:37.101 --> 00:00:40.021
the underlying cause of the heart block.

00:00:40.022 --> 00:00:42.041
If it's a reaction to medications,

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.060
a doctor may stop those medications.

00:00:44.061 --> 00:00:46.181
Or certainly with electrolyte imbalances,

00:00:46.182 --> 00:00:47.881
these can easily be corrected.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.320
But aside from that, there's not much to do for this heart rhythm.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.200
Nobody would ever get a pacemaker just for a first degree AV block.

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.119
We're gonna learn how to save a life today.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.239
This is naloxone, aka Narcan,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.599
a life saving medication

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.700
that can reverse an opiate overdose.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.239
Imagine this cup is an opiate receptor in your brain.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.799
And this lime is fentanyl,

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.039
one of the most dangerous opiates in the world.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.999
When fentanyl binds to opiate receptors

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.239
in areas of the brain that regulate breathing,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.679
it can cause respiratory depression and death.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.719
Imagine this apple is naloxone.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.439
Naloxone knocks a dangerous opiate off the receptor

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.759
and prevents any other opiates from binding.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.279
Let's follow the CDC guidelines

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.519
and see how easy it is to use Narcan.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.719
First recognize the signs of an opioid overdose

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.799
and call 911.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.999
They may not respond to voice or touch.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.159
Their breathing may be slow,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.399
uneven, or stopped.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.999
Then administer Narcan

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.999
immediately.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.119
Lay the person on their back,

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.039
tilt their head,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.319
hold naloxone nasal spray like this.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.399
Gently place the nozzle in either nostril

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.959
and press the plunger firmly

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.079
to shoot the narkhand into their nose.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.759
After a few minutes,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.340
if the person does not respond,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.860
give them an additional dose in the other nostril.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.439
I believe that

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.599
Narcan should be available in every school,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.159
hospital, and workplace.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.119
You can get naloxone from a pharmacy

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.399
without a prescription in every state.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.199
Hopefully you never need to use it,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.239
but you should be prepared for an emergency.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.327

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
Four things you're trying to do when you get cold water, right?

00:00:02.241 --> 00:00:04.241
First of all, we're not trying to become cold adaptive.

00:00:04.242 --> 00:00:05.441
We're trying to cold shock the body.

00:00:05.442 --> 00:00:08.001
We're not trying to become an Eskimo and adapt to the cold. Right.

00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:08.961
Trying to cold shock the body.

00:00:08.962 --> 00:00:10.281
Yeah. So three,

00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:12.801
3 minutes to six minutes is perfect.

00:00:12.802 --> 00:00:14.741
Three minutes minimum, six minutes maximum.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.360
Colder is not better. Longer is not better.

00:00:17.361 --> 00:00:19.161
After three minutes, you've gotten the massive

00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:21.561
maximum amount of peripheral vase of construction. Right?

00:00:21.562 --> 00:00:23.661
So you've had this massive, um,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.640
construction of the peripheral vascular system,

00:00:25.641 --> 00:00:27.761
which is driving blood into the core, liver,

00:00:27.762 --> 00:00:29.201
lungs, pancreas, kidney, brain.

00:00:29.202 --> 00:00:30.021
Right. Um,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.700
very much mimicking what happens in deep sleep

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.840
when we go into that paralytic state where we're not mobile

00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:38.881
and blood has a tendency to move to the core,

00:00:38.882 --> 00:00:41.161
into the brain. The second thing that's happening is

00:00:41.162 --> 00:00:42.921
you're activating something called brown fat.

00:00:42.922 --> 00:00:45.121
Brown fats, a very special type of fat in the body

00:00:45.122 --> 00:00:47.561
because it's our thermostat, right?

00:00:47.562 --> 00:00:50.621
It is exchanging a calorie for a measure of heat.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.440
So there's a costing to going from being cold

00:00:53.441 --> 00:00:55.601
to warming back up to 98.6 degrees.

00:00:55.602 --> 00:00:57.881
There's a calorie burn. There's a calorie. Yeah.

00:00:57.882 --> 00:00:59.282
I mean, there's a deficit to this. This is

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720
When you're experiencing an emotional state,

00:00:01.721 --> 00:00:04.401
you're experiencing it in this area of the brain called the amygdala.

00:00:04.402 --> 00:00:06.441
Yeah. And the amygdala. So.

00:00:06.442 --> 00:00:07.841
So if you're passionate, if you're related,

00:00:07.842 --> 00:00:09.241
if you're joyful, if you're aroused,

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:11.921
if you're upset, you're feeling that emotion

00:00:11.922 --> 00:00:13.861
in an area of the brain called the amygdala.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.800
The interesting thing about the amygdala is

00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:19.141
it is the soul gateway to the hippocampus.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.100
Right. And what's stored in the hippocampus is our memory.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:22.760
Right.

00:00:22.761 --> 00:00:27.021
So when you are recalling activities from your lifetime and memories,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.420
um, that's activating an area of the brain called the hippocampus.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.320
So, in other words,

00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:32.841
we need to go through the amygdala,

00:00:32.842 --> 00:00:34.421
the emotional center of the brain,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.990
to reach the hippocampus, the memory.

00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.240
If your anxiety is stopping you from leading a normal life,

00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:04.721
here's what you need to do.

00:00:04.722 --> 00:00:07.601
Anxiety, basically is a fear of the future,

00:00:07.602 --> 00:00:09.241
of something going wrong.

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:11.961
What is actually happening when you're dealing with anxiety

00:00:11.962 --> 00:00:14.041
is you're not present anymore.

00:00:14.042 --> 00:00:17.281
So what's a practical way to stop that?

00:00:17.282 --> 00:00:19.721
The key is to come back into the present.

00:00:19.722 --> 00:00:21.801
So we wanna stop your mind.

00:00:21.802 --> 00:00:26.721
Take charge of this feeling by using this right now.

00:00:26.722 --> 00:00:32.201
I am aware of the sensation in my chest right now.

00:00:32.202 --> 00:00:35.481
So what? I'm not going to acknowledge it?

00:00:35.482 --> 00:00:37.801
I'm not going to pay attention to it?

00:00:37.802 --> 00:00:39.281
I'm not gonna give it power?

00:00:39.282 --> 00:00:41.841
I'm gonna shut it off. I'll use this as an example.

00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:44.381
You take your child to the mall.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.040
The child wants to get ice cream,

00:00:46.041 --> 00:00:47.961
but you know you're gonna go home and have dinner.

00:00:47.962 --> 00:00:50.681
So you tell the child no. So what is the child gonna do?

00:00:50.682 --> 00:00:53.841
They're gonna try to get your attention by lying on the ground

00:00:53.842 --> 00:00:57.601
kicking and screaming. Because as long as it can get your attention,

00:00:57.602 --> 00:00:59.201
they're gonna try to get what they want.

00:00:59.202 --> 00:01:01.361
What's the best way to deal with that child,

00:01:01.362 --> 00:01:04.041
the feeling of anxiety? You just say whatever.

00:01:04.042 --> 00:01:06.281
I'm gonna sit on the bench here until you're finished,

00:01:06.282 --> 00:01:07.881
and then we're going home to have dinner.

00:01:07.882 --> 00:01:09.381
When you take that attitude,

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.280
it's just a quick,

00:01:10.281 --> 00:01:14.081
easy hack to sort of use and feel your system settle down.

00:01:14.082 --> 00:01:15.366
Kill it with indifference.

00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.760
A lady who came in, who'd been on heroin for seven years,

00:00:02.761 --> 00:00:04.521
she said to me, when she first came in,

00:00:04.522 --> 00:00:07.201
my therapist told me to make sure that I let you know

00:00:07.202 --> 00:00:09.321
I have self destructive behaviour.

00:00:09.322 --> 00:00:10.881
And I smiled, I said, really?

00:00:10.882 --> 00:00:12.881
What would make you think you're self destructive?

00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:14.481
And she was surprised by that

00:00:14.482 --> 00:00:15.841
and she looked at me and she goes, well,

00:00:15.842 --> 00:00:17.921
I'm sticking a needle with heroin in my arm.

00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:19.761
Don't you think that's self destructive?

00:00:19.762 --> 00:00:20.881
And I said, actually, no,

00:00:20.882 --> 00:00:23.361
I don't. I think you're trying to feel better.

00:00:23.362 --> 00:00:25.401
And I'll bet you when you stuck the needle in your arm,

00:00:25.402 --> 00:00:26.961
you actually did feel better.

00:00:26.962 --> 00:00:28.201
And she sort of smiled, she goes,

00:00:28.202 --> 00:00:28.961
well, yeah.

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:30.961
And I said, that's what you were trying to do.

00:00:30.962 --> 00:00:32.921
The substance is destructive,

00:00:32.922 --> 00:00:37.121
you're not destructive. And you could see the shift in her face.

00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:40.561
We have to stop shaming and guilting and blaming these people

00:00:40.562 --> 00:00:44.801
and understanding why they got into addiction in the first place.

00:00:44.802 --> 00:00:46.801
It's not about their characters, morals,

00:00:46.802 --> 00:00:48.241
will power or ethics.

00:00:48.242 --> 00:00:52.039
Yet that's the common perception of what addiction is all about.

00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.560
less than an hour after

00:00:02.561 --> 00:00:09.040
Trump announced the 25% tariffs on both Mexican and Canadian goods

00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:13.540
starting tomorrow our stock market is now in freefall

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.580
with Adele Jones plummeting over 800 points

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.980
when Trump said he was going to make America great again

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.640
apparently he actually meant to say he was going to crash the American economy

00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:30.420
because that is what is unfolding in front of us in real time

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.640
and I know that many of you all voted for him

00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:36.140
because he was going to lower the price of eggs

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.280
and not only is that not happening

00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:42.960
but the 25% tariffs are going to be a big impact

00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:45.240
on many Americans in this country

00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:49.300
it is really unclear what happens from this point forward

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.860
but one thing that is very clear

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.740
is that the US is a giant embarrassment on the world stage currently

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Is it just me

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:07.081
or is there this racism towards Indian people on social media,

00:00:07.082 --> 00:00:10.121
especially on TikTok? I think we've always experienced racism,

00:00:10.122 --> 00:00:13.881
but I think it's so much more prevalent on social media.

00:00:13.882 --> 00:00:18.781
And it seems like people think it's okay to say certain things

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.360
about Indian people. And I think us as a community

00:00:22.361 --> 00:00:26.161
and as a population have become so desensitized towards it

00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:27.681
that we almost just ignore it

00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:31.961
or we just laugh it off or we even just kinda join into it sometimes.

00:00:31.962 --> 00:00:34.481
And I think that this is because of internalised racism.

00:00:34.482 --> 00:00:36.821
And I think we've become so used to,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.920
so used to this.

00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:41.381
I can't even begin to tell you how this affects somebody's

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.480
sense of self and their self esteem.

00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:46.921
We internalize this and, and we feel like we're not good enough.

00:00:46.922 --> 00:00:48.441
We feel like we're inferior.

00:00:48.442 --> 00:00:51.001
And this all affects us on a very unconscious level.

00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:53.621
So it might not be conscious to us,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.600
but it's just, I don't know.

00:00:55.601 --> 00:00:59.793
What are your thoughts? I just think it's so malicious and, and harmful.

00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.220
A day in the life of a psychologist in South Africa.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.000
So for those of you who don't know me,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.560
um, my practices name is Conscious Psychology

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.080
and this is me just pulling up to my practice

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.500
at my wellness centre called sanctuary in the city.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.240
To be honest,

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.700
this is probably two days in my life.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.540
Um, this is just Jessica at reception

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.180
and I make my way upstairs into our small waiting room

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.380
and welcome to my office.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.360
This is where I see clients and do a lot of my content

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.200
creation. Of course

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.380
I had to get a dash and looking door stop.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.800
When I get to work

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.520
I initially just check my emails and any new um

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.100
submissions on the website.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.000
I also start making some content.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.100
That's just me.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.080
If you know,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.140
you know this is just me making coffee.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.080
I think this has got to be one of the most

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.500
favourite parts of my day.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.960
My friend Trisha came to visit

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.400
who is also a life coach

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.740
and we just got started on

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.420
creating a workshop that we're hosting in March

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.880
and then it started raining.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.600
If you know me,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.660
you know I absolutely love the rain

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.300
and then what's a day without a mirror selfie?

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.520
I decided to write a little

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.980
inspirational note for my team.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.400
It was time to start setting up for my journal club

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.080
which I host once a month

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.240

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.400
as well as other psychologists get together.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.000
And we speak about different journal articles

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.480
just to keep a breast within the psychology field

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.240
and get our C P.

00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.620
People are using this medication to treat fibromyalgia,

00:00:02.621 --> 00:00:05.521
long covid, autoimmune conditions and me.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.320
But is it actually beneficial?

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.140
I'm Dr. Ray,

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.461
a GP based in the UK, and this without doubt

00:00:10.462 --> 00:00:12.541
has been one of the most common questions people have been asking me

00:00:12.542 --> 00:00:13.721
of the last couple of weeks.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.620
And it's about low dose naloxone,

00:00:15.621 --> 00:00:17.301
or known as LDN. So

00:00:17.302 --> 00:00:20.741
LDN's licensed indication is treat people who are addicted to opioids

00:00:20.742 --> 00:00:25.481
such as morphine. And it starts at about 50 mg to 100 mg dosage per day.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.700
However, off license

00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:29.801
it can be used to help treat chronic pain conditions

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.300
such as fibromyalgia. But this is usually a much lower dose,

00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:36.601
about 3 mg to around four and a/2 mg per day.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.740
Now, it's thought to work

00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:40.521
by blocking various cells in the body's immune system,

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.260
which increases levels of endorphins,

00:00:42.261 --> 00:00:43.241
which is a hormone,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.080
and this is important in regulating pain and receptor thresholds.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.380
So this was the largest study I could find on LDN and fibromyalgia

00:00:51.381 --> 00:00:53.521
and included 431 patients.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.920
And the review included randomized controlled trials,

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.340
case series and non RCTs as well.

00:00:59.341 --> 00:01:02.841
And it concluded that LDN does help with fibromyalgia pain.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.660
But it's important to note that the studies included

00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:08.601
weren't of great quality and the sample size was relatively small.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.620
So this is the most recent study I can find,

00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:12.921
which was done this year in 2024

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.700
and include 99 people who had fibromyalgia.

00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:17.801
It randomly assigned them to two groups.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.680
One was treated With the 6 mg of LDN per day

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.520
and one was treated with placebo.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.300
And I found there was no different between people treated with LDN

00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:29.821
and placebo. They did state that it did help memory problems

00:01:29.822 --> 00:01:32.141
in patient fibromyalgia. So as you can see,

00:01:32.142 --> 00:01:33.501
the evidence is a bit mixed

00:01:33.502 --> 00:01:34.761
and it's not conclusive

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.680
as to whether LDN helps with fibromyalgia or not.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.340
But, you know,

00:01:38.341 --> 00:01:39.261
anecdotally speaking,

00:01:39.262 --> 00:01:42.181
I have seen patients on LDN who have reported fantastic results

00:01:42.182 --> 00:01:43.921
and it has really helped their fibromyalgia.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.620
On the flip side,

00:01:44.621 --> 00:01:47.761
I've also seen patients who are on it and not reported great results.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.500
Yes, absolutely.

00:01:48.501 --> 00:01:49.861
I think it's something worth exploring.

00:01:49.862 --> 00:01:51.521
If you're someone with fibromyalgia

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.760
and you've tried a lot of treatments aren't working,

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.200
it's something to maybe consider,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.380
but make sure you bring up with your doctor

00:01:56.381 --> 00:01:58.521
because not everyone is suitable for LDN

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.040
and you need certain test done before you can start it.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.540
But just be mindful it's not a miracle cure for fibromyalgia,

00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:05.301
despite what you might see on the internet

00:02:05.302 --> 00:02:06.881
or TikTok or other platforms.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.860
But I think it's definitely a move in the right direction,

00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:10.341
and I think these discussions are great

00:02:10.342 --> 00:02:12.221
in helping us try and figure out a cure

00:02:12.222 --> 00:02:14.261
or treatment for fibromyalgia,

00:02:14.262 --> 00:02:16.841
because as of yet, there's not been a great move forward.

00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.260
I just sent a patient in for an emergency operation

00:00:02.261 --> 00:00:04.441
for one of the most painful conditions that you can have

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.700
and a lot of people don't know about it

00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:07.601
and I think everybody needs to be aware of it.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.820
I'm Doctor Ray, a GP based in the UK,

00:00:09.821 --> 00:00:12.921
and this condition is an infected pilonidal sinus.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.380
So pilonidal sinus is a very small hole

00:00:15.381 --> 00:00:16.321
and a tunnel

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.360
at the junction between your lower back and the top of your buttocks.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.860
Now, a lot of people actually have this without knowing about it

00:00:21.861 --> 00:00:23.041
because if it's not infected,

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.400
most time most people will have no symptoms.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.380
However, if these signs is getting infected,

00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:28.061
they can be very,

00:00:28.062 --> 00:00:32.281
very painful and actually very bad and almost always need an operation.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.160
So I've known of cases of patients in plastic surgery

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.200
because the signs were so big and infected,

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.900
the amount of tissue removed was vast,

00:00:38.901 --> 00:00:40.121
therefore need replacing.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.980
And these are the symptoms you need to look out for.

00:00:41.981 --> 00:00:43.741
The obvious one is pain. Now,

00:00:43.742 --> 00:00:45.141
this is a very, very bad,

00:00:45.142 --> 00:00:47.441
severe pain and it does not get any better.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.500
And it's in the lower back,

00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:49.761
around the buttock area.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.660
You might also have some bleeding and discharge from the lower back

00:00:52.661 --> 00:00:53.561
and the sinus.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.840
The early sign is often just a small bump at the lower back

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.660
that's a bit tender. Now,

00:00:58.661 --> 00:00:59.141
if it's left,

00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:01.861
you can become septic from this and you can become very unwell.

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:03.601
You can have A fever, chills.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.560
Now, we don't fully know what causes the pilonidal sinus.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.040
Here are the three of the most common reasons why you might get one.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.320
The first one is from general friction from the top of the buttocks.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.080
This can push hair inwards into the sinus.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.360
Secondly is having loose hair that gathers in the area.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.800
This can enter the sinus, which can become infected.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.100
And finally, if you're sitting for long periods,

00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:25.061
you're higher risk of getting infected by an otitis

00:01:25.062 --> 00:01:25.861
media

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.980
treatment for an infected pilonidal sinus

00:01:27.981 --> 00:01:29.701
includes an operation and antibiotics.

00:01:29.702 --> 00:01:32.401
After this, if you have a pilonidal sinus that's not infected,

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.700
you may not need an operation or antibiotics.

00:01:34.701 --> 00:01:37.461
And just keep an eye on it to make sure if it does get infected,

00:01:37.462 --> 00:01:38.458
it's treated quickly.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.700
We are raising mentally weak children because we overdo for them.

00:00:07.701 --> 00:00:10.301
One of the concepts in the book I really love is,

00:00:10.302 --> 00:00:13.081
if you do too much for your children,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.720
you are increasing your self esteem by stealing theirs.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.840
That we develop mental toughness by solving problems.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.420
So when. If my daughter would forget her homework at home,

00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:32.321
nobody's bringing it to school.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.980
If she didn't bring a jacket on a cold day,

00:00:35.981 --> 00:00:37.981
even though her mother told her to,

00:00:37.982 --> 00:00:40.001
nobody's bringing her the jacket.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.740
Um, it's so important to.

00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:46.081
When a child says, I'm bored,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.220
rather than you fix it, just say,

He is coming out onto the balcony of Saint Peter's behind me.

00:00:04.181 --> 00:00:08.561
Now, that is the spot where the Pope gives the Urbi et Orbi blessing

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.540
on Easter Sunday and Christmas Day.

00:00:10.541 --> 00:00:13.501
It's also the spot where he appeared for the first time

00:00:13.502 --> 00:00:17.101
when he was elected in 2,013.

00:00:17.102 --> 00:00:21.401
Now, Francis is not able to speak for a long time

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.300
because of the pneumonia that he has experienced

00:00:25.301 --> 00:00:27.001
and has been suffering from.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.180
He is going through physiotherapy every day

00:00:29.181 --> 00:00:31.001
to try and regain his voice.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.860
But he has been shown a determination to try and get out and about

00:00:35.861 --> 00:00:37.301
to meet, uh,

00:00:37.302 --> 00:00:38.861
people. He, uh,

00:00:38.862 --> 00:00:42.461
over the Easter weekend, on Thursday before, uh,

00:00:42.462 --> 00:00:44.181
Easter, he went to prison.

00:00:44.182 --> 00:00:46.061
They met with inmates. Saturday night,

00:00:46.062 --> 00:00:47.981
last night, he was out in the, uh,

00:00:47.982 --> 00:00:50.421
basilica. He greeted pilgrims there.

00:00:50.422 --> 00:00:53.021
And as we can see, he is now, uh,

00:00:53.022 --> 00:00:56.101
in Saint Peter's to offer that blessing.

00:00:56.102 --> 00:00:57.701
For at Easter Sunday,

00:00:57.702 --> 00:01:00.661
we're just listening to the Vatican national anthem,

00:01:00.662 --> 00:01:05.181
and then we are going to hopefully hear something from the pope.

00:01:05.182 --> 00:01:06.821
Now, on Easter Sunday,

00:01:06.822 --> 00:01:09.921
the pope normally gives a longer reflection,

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.920
sort of state of the world address,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.180
where he addresses different conflicts across the world

00:01:15.181 --> 00:01:16.561
and appeals for peace.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.340
Traditionally. Now,

00:01:18.341 --> 00:01:22.101
we're not expecting the pope to deliver a long address,

00:01:22.102 --> 00:01:27.601
that long address, but the Vatican are expected to release that text.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.980
What we are expecting the Pope to do

00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:32.041
is actually offer the blessing himself.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.820
The words of blessing, which Include an indulgence,

00:01:35.821 --> 00:01:40.101
which for Catholics is the remission from the punishment of sins.

00:01:40.102 --> 00:01:42.301
It is offered on Easter Sunday.

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:43.961
I'm just checking behind me here.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.740
He is definitely up, up there.

00:01:45.741 --> 00:01:50.461
And he will be preparing to give that blessing now.

00:01:50.462 --> 00:01:54.141
It's not clear whether there will be another aid or cardinal

00:01:54.142 --> 00:01:55.821
to read the address of the pope.

00:01:55.822 --> 00:01:57.801
Perhaps the pope will just give the blessing

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.300
and we'll have to wait and see.

00:01:59.301 --> 00:02:02.321
There's a lot of expectation here in the square.

Feeling particularly down,

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:11.320
and I would love your tips and encouragement and all your ideas.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.880
Um, I calculated out how long it's gonna take me to get out of, um,

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.400
my student loan debt.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.720
I'm 10 years out of med school now,

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.360
and it hasn't gotten any better. Right.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.340
Um, but the past two years,

00:00:31.341 --> 00:00:32.761
I've been really, like,

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.740
working my butt off to try and pay off the debt that we've racked up

00:00:39.741 --> 00:00:40.641
while my

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.840
now deceased ex husband, how do I say that?

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.160
Was struggling with a substance use disorder.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.000
And I stayed much longer than,

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.380
well, I don't know.

00:00:57.381 --> 00:00:59.301
I was gonna say I stayed much longer than I should have,

00:00:59.302 --> 00:01:01.941
but then sometimes I think I didn't. I,

00:01:01.942 --> 00:01:03.701
I don't know. It's confusing,

00:01:03.702 --> 00:01:06.021
and I feel so much guilt either way.

00:01:06.022 --> 00:01:06.821
But,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.200
hey, I,

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.500
you know, tackled all of that debt

00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:15.801
and feeling like maybe I'm making some progress.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.800
And then I just calculated out that

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.760
if I keep going at the pace I've been going for the past two years,

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.120
it's gonna take me 47 years to get out of debt.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.320
Not save for retirement,

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.520
not nothing.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.400
I have no nothing.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.440
And I feel like since leaving the relationship,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.160
you know, my business

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.860
suffered while I was in the relationship.

00:01:53.861 --> 00:01:56.101
And if you guys were with me, then,

00:01:56.102 --> 00:01:58.521
you know, kind of the things that happened. And

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.640
I am.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.220
Where is I even going with that?

00:02:05.221 --> 00:02:06.281
I don't know.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.880
I owe,

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.840
like, I feel like When I started,

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.280
like, racking up the debt,

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.200
and we were doing, like,

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:24.360
hospitalizations and rehab and try to make ends meet while he was sick,

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.520
we, uh.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.340
Or I kept telling myself, like,

00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:30.981
it doesn't matter, you know,

00:02:30.982 --> 00:02:33.601
you just. The important thing is that everybody is okay.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.180

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.240
and feeling a little hopeless.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.320
And I know that there's a way out.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.600
Sometimes it doesn't feel like it.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.280
I'm just feeling, like,

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.060
less confident in my ability to find that way out,

00:03:08.061 --> 00:03:09.081
I think,

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:10.760
and.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.580
Ugh,

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.120
it's hard.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.840
It's really hard.

00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.300
So I think what this person was asking about

00:00:02.301 --> 00:00:03.541
is why

00:00:03.542 --> 00:00:08.341
a psychiatrist will sometimes give someone a tentative diagnosis

00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:12.461
or a maybe. We'll say somebody has a certain diagnosis,

00:00:12.462 --> 00:00:14.881
but we need to rule out other things.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.940
And we may say that we need additional observation time,

00:00:17.941 --> 00:00:20.221
or we need to talk to some more people.

00:00:20.222 --> 00:00:22.361
We call that collateral information,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.000
or that we need more testing of some sort.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.260
This person asked, is this a common thing that happens?

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:29.101
And, yeah,

00:00:29.102 --> 00:00:32.181
it is pretty common. A lot of that has to do with the fact

00:00:32.182 --> 00:00:35.221
that mental health issues are so complicated,

00:00:35.222 --> 00:00:40.261
and we try to organize them based on diagnoses and symptoms

00:00:40.262 --> 00:00:43.301
as best we can. But even with that,

00:00:43.302 --> 00:00:44.701
it can be really tricky

00:00:44.702 --> 00:00:49.081
to tell what kind of diagnosis fits a person best sometimes.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.580
But insurance companies require,

00:00:51.581 --> 00:00:53.701
in order to pay for a visit,

00:00:53.702 --> 00:00:56.221
that we have some sort of diagnosis documented.

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:57.381
So even if we're not sure,

00:00:57.382 --> 00:00:59.661
we have to take our best guess in the moment

00:00:59.662 --> 00:01:01.921
so that insurance will cover your visit.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.140
This kind of situation is especially common in people

00:01:05.141 --> 00:01:06.661
where we think they might have ADHD

00:01:06.662 --> 00:01:09.821
or autism, because these are neurodevelopmental disorders.

00:01:09.822 --> 00:01:10.581
And what that means

00:01:10.582 --> 00:01:14.141
is that they're gonna be relatively consistent over time.

00:01:14.142 --> 00:01:16.341
Doesn't mean they're gonna be looking the same

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:17.861
in every single situation.

00:01:17.862 --> 00:01:21.801
But the symptoms kind of persist throughout someone's life.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.160
And of course, we're only seeing you for a snapshot of time.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.180
And if you have anything else that's going on at the same time.

00:01:28.181 --> 00:01:28.981
So, for example,

00:01:28.982 --> 00:01:32.861
an anxiety disorder that we think might be contributing, um,

00:01:32.862 --> 00:01:35.741
substance use that you're struggling with, depression,

00:01:35.742 --> 00:01:38.881
anything like that. Those are things that are more episodic,

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.820
meaning they don't last typically forever.

00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:44.161
They kind of have a start and an end date,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.740
but during that time, they can really affect symptoms,

00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:49.001
and they can look a lot like other disorders.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.380
At the end of the day, though,

00:01:50.381 --> 00:01:53.541
things like autism, ADHD, depression,

00:01:53.542 --> 00:01:55.921
anxiety, all sorts of different things like that

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.080
technically

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.020
don't usually require a psychiatric testing for a diagnosis.

00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:04.041
There's something called clinical diagnosis,

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.180
which just mean that based on our clinical expertise,

00:02:07.181 --> 00:02:08.541
we should be able to sit down with you,

00:02:08.542 --> 00:02:11.141
have a conversation, gather the information we need,

00:02:11.142 --> 00:02:14.661
and determine whether or not you fit with that diagnosis

00:02:14.662 --> 00:02:16.641
or that diagnosis fits with you.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.220
That being said, this stuff is so complicated,

00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:21.821
and there are definitely times when neuropsychiatric testing

00:02:21.822 --> 00:02:23.481
can be really, really helpful.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.060
So hopefully that answers your question.

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:26.321
Just to kind of summarize,

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.700
basically what it means is that we have to come up with a diagnosis

00:02:29.701 --> 00:02:32.401
for administrative or business purposes

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.460
whether we like it or not.

00:02:33.461 --> 00:02:35.781
So even if it's not completely clear,

00:02:35.782 --> 00:02:38.161
we have to put our money down on something,

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.860
take our best guess based on what we've seen.

00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:42.821
But at the end of the day,

00:02:42.822 --> 00:02:44.861
mental health issues are really complicated,

00:02:44.862 --> 00:02:47.301
and Everybody's experience is very unique

00:02:47.302 --> 00:02:50.529
and so we may not know for sure sometimes
