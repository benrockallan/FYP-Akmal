Anxiety can make it FEEL like there's something physically wrong with you

00:00:03.754 --> 00:00:04.905
even when there's not

00:00:04.914 --> 00:00:08.993
here are 4 WEIRD physical symptoms that can actually be caused by anxiety

00:00:08.994 --> 00:00:11.153
from a licensed therapist and certified trauma professional

00:00:11.154 --> 00:00:12.233
make sure you listen to the last

00:00:12.234 --> 00:00:14.145
it tends to catch the most people off guard

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.349
1) anxiety can make your throat feel sore or tight

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.070
even like there is a ""literal lump in your throat""

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.509
this is referred to as a ""globus sensation"" in medical terms

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.310
and is a direct result of muscle bracing from anxiety

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.854
2) disrupted breathing

00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:29.423
either difficulty getting a full breath

00:00:29.424 --> 00:00:31.823
tightness in chest or heart palpitations

00:00:31.824 --> 00:00:35.623
the fight/flight response as a component of anxiety prioritizes oxygen

00:00:35.624 --> 00:00:39.823
and therefore bloodflow to the muscles & away from your internal organs

00:00:39.824 --> 00:00:42.275
this can make breathing feel weird & labored

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.830
3) numbness, dizziness or tingling

00:00:44.831 --> 00:00:47.590
remember since bloodflow is prioritized to the muscles

00:00:47.591 --> 00:00:48.127
a lot of times

00:00:48.128 --> 00:00:51.230
this means that tingling will come to the muscles in the appendages

00:00:51.231 --> 00:00:52.548
your arms and legs

00:00:52.551 --> 00:00:55.208
while dizziness or lightheadedness is common due to 

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:56.588
LACK of oxygen in the brain

00:00:56.631 --> 00:00:59.388
4) depersonalization & derealization

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.106
these out of body body experiences can feel REALLY weird & scary

00:01:03.153 --> 00:01:06.466
but they're directly connected to the elevated levels of adrenaline

00:01:06.473 --> 00:01:09.506
in your bloodstream from the fight or flight response from anxiety

00:01:09.713 --> 00:01:11.632
this can look like your limbs feeling strange

00:01:11.633 --> 00:01:13.152
your face looking weird in the mirror

00:01:13.153 --> 00:01:14.312
life feeling unreal

00:01:14.313 --> 00:01:15.986
feeling detached from reality

00:01:16.113 --> 00:01:17.312
feeling disconnected from your body

00:01:17.313 --> 00:01:19.266
or like everything is moving in slow motion

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.920
if your symptoms are negatively impacting your life

00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:24.480
consider learning more about managing your mental health

00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:26.400
regulating your central nervous system

00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:28.040
and even reaching out to a professional

00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:30.738

Here are my 3 top tips as a therapist

00:00:02.511 --> 00:00:05.228
to overcome health anxiety.

00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:10.628
Number one, you have to recognize what's happening.

00:00:10.791 --> 00:00:13.108
If we don't name it as health anxiety,

00:00:13.551 --> 00:00:14.870
we tend to continue

00:00:14.871 --> 00:00:17.068
going round and round with the patterns

00:00:17.231 --> 00:00:19.748
because we're trying to think our way

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.330
to a feeling of safety.

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:23.770
If you can name it as health anxiety,

00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:26.410
you can address the health anxiety

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:29.650
as opposed to trying to address the symptoms,

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:31.610
which may not be the real issue.

00:00:32.463 --> 00:00:36.156
Secondly, we have to then break the pattern.

00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:38.636
If you can recognize what's happening,

00:00:38.863 --> 00:00:39.942
you then have to stop

00:00:39.943 --> 00:00:42.956
the habits and the behaviors that perpetuate the cycle.

00:00:43.183 --> 00:00:44.982
So the constant checking of symptoms,

00:00:44.983 --> 00:00:46.422
researching of symptoms,

00:00:46.423 --> 00:00:48.596
looking for reassurance about symptoms.

00:00:48.783 --> 00:00:50.796
We have to break those patterns and cycles.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.228
And then thirdly,

00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:53.468
the recognition

00:00:53.751 --> 00:00:56.828
that what health anxiety often really is

00:00:57.071 --> 00:00:59.548
is an inner sense of not feeling safe.

00:00:59.631 --> 00:01:02.988
So if we can work on calming your nervous system

00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:06.508
and cultivating that inner state of safety,

00:01:07.137 --> 00:01:09.576
you won't need to have those health anxieties

00:01:09.577 --> 00:01:10.762
in the first place.

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:12.416

4,anxietyjosh,anxietyjosh,https://www.tiktok.com/@anxietyjosh,"00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.860
Hi, I'm Josh,

00:00:00.861 --> 00:00:03.341
an anxiety therapist and previous sufferer.

00:00:03.342 --> 00:00:07.261
Here are 10 signs that you're struggling with an anxiety disorder.

00:00:07.262 --> 00:00:10.261
The first sign is an obsession with how you feel.

00:00:10.262 --> 00:00:12.621
You suddenly feel weird, different to how you used to,

00:00:12.622 --> 00:00:15.261
and you feel the sense of doom and trepidation.

00:00:15.262 --> 00:00:18.641
The second sign is you're bombarded with what if thoughts,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.660
scary what if thoughts, not the fun ones,

00:00:20.661 --> 00:00:22.181
usually about your sanity,

00:00:22.182 --> 00:00:24.261
your well being, your health.

00:00:24.262 --> 00:00:27.901
The third sign, a strange symptoms that feel magnified.

00:00:27.902 --> 00:00:31.741
Heart palpitations, maybe feel dissociated and not quite here.

00:00:31.742 --> 00:00:34.781
Maybe you feel dizzy, lightheaded and things just look strange.

00:00:34.782 --> 00:00:36.761
No. 4 is intrusive thoughts,

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.700
strange taboo

00:00:37.701 --> 00:00:40.581
ones that you usually don't have or they usually don't bother you.

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:42.381
Suddenly they now feel important.

00:00:42.382 --> 00:00:44.821
Number five is constant reassurance seeking.

00:00:44.822 --> 00:00:46.581
Maybe you've been down a Reddit hole

00:00:46.582 --> 00:00:48.541
constantly asking Doctor, Google,

00:00:48.542 --> 00:00:50.261
yet you're still there in the same place

00:00:50.262 --> 00:00:52.581
trying to find 100% assurance that you're okay.

00:00:52.582 --> 00:00:55.501
Number six is experiencing a lot of panic attacks

00:00:55.502 --> 00:00:57.141
and fearing those panic attacks.

00:00:57.142 --> 00:00:58.381
One hits you out the blue,

00:00:58.382 --> 00:00:59.741
you're not sure what's going on,

00:00:59.742 --> 00:01:01.541
so you monitor for it all day

00:01:01.542 --> 00:01:04.421
because you're afraid of having another panic attack

00:01:04.422 --> 00:01:06.721
and then you build your life around avoiding them.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.720
No.7 is threat monitoring.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.700
You're monitoring either your thoughts or sensations in your body

00:01:12.701 --> 00:01:14.601
looking for the next threat

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.680
or uncomfortable experience that frightens you.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.340
No.8 is you resist and fear the emotion of anxiety.

00:01:21.341 --> 00:01:24.381
You try To get rid of it, maybe you've looked for lots of things like

00:01:24.382 --> 00:01:25.501
how do I get rid of this now?

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:27.001
How to stop a panic attack,

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.580
anything to try and get rid of it.

00:01:28.581 --> 00:01:32.501
And that urgency, No. 9 is that you avoid doing stuff that you used to,

00:01:32.502 --> 00:01:34.341
that what non anxious you would do,

00:01:34.342 --> 00:01:37.341
you've put off because you're waiting to feel better.

00:01:37.342 --> 00:01:40.401
No. 10, anxiety becomes your default thought.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.460
Whenever you're not distracted or busy,

00:01:42.461 --> 00:01:45.061
you check how you feel and it's the default thought.

00:01:45.062 --> 00:01:47.981
I must fix myself, I must work on this,

00:01:47.982 --> 00:01:51.301
I must get rid of this. And it becomes the centre of your life.

00:01:51.302 --> 00:01:53.261
I've been there. I've got through it.

00:01:53.262 --> 00:01:55.281

For anxiety specifically,

00:00:02.108 --> 00:00:03.351
what can people do

00:00:03.428 --> 00:00:05.827
to make sure that they're not so much of a victim

00:00:05.828 --> 00:00:07.947
to that feeling of overwhelming anxiety

00:00:07.948 --> 00:00:09.587
that can just creep up on them every single day?

00:00:09.588 --> 00:00:10.791
So 4 simple things.

00:00:10.828 --> 00:00:13.111
Never leave a situation because you're anxious,

00:00:13.268 --> 00:00:15.467
because then the anxiety will control you.

00:00:15.468 --> 00:00:19.197
Breathe 2 minutes 3x1 day.

00:00:19.198 --> 00:00:20.280
This will save you

00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:23.520
like thousands of dollars of therapy if you do this.

00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:26.560
It's the 15 second breath for 2 minutes.

00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:27.938
So that's 8 breaths

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.360
4 seconds in,

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.939
hold it for a second and 1/2

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.560
8 seconds out.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.080
So double the exhale as the inhale,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.707
hold it out for a second and 1/2.

00:00:37.708 --> 00:00:38.947
That's 15 seconds.

00:00:38.948 --> 00:00:40.067
Repeat times 8.

00:00:40.068 --> 00:00:42.631
It just feels like you took a Valium

What is the most common cause for panic attacks?

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.740
That's, um,

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.700
adrenal overload. Most,

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.720
most of the time, nutritionally speaking,

00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:12.741
it's a low vitamin B1. So,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.760
I mean, I think you should do an experiment

00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:16.481
and this would be a great experiment.

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:18.221
If you're in a panic attack,

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.680
just take some be one and just watch what happens.

00:00:20.681 --> 00:00:21.721
Within about three minutes,

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:23.441
it's like, oh,

00:00:23.442 --> 00:00:24.241
I can, I can breathe.

00:00:24.242 --> 00:00:27.961
I feel calmer. But then the breathing is key too.

00:00:27.962 --> 00:00:30.601
You don't wanna hyperventilate when you have a panic attack.

00:00:30.602 --> 00:00:32.261
You wanna slow the breathing down

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.840
in for about four seconds and out for four seconds.

00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:38.861
And that will pull yourself out of a panic attack.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.620
Believe it or not, the more you breathe,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.600
you're thinking you're getting more oxygen,

Depression can become so severe

00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:03.964
that you lose touch with reality

00:00:03.965 --> 00:00:05.844
and develop psychotic symptoms.

00:00:05.845 --> 00:00:07.284
These psychotic symptoms

00:00:07.285 --> 00:00:09.284
are delusions and hallucinations.

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:11.924
However, delusions tend to be more common

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:13.244
than the hallucinations.

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:15.724
The delusions can take on a persecutory

00:00:15.725 --> 00:00:17.335
or nihilistic tone.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.258
Persecutory is when you feel attacked in some way.

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:22.818
You may feel like people are talking about you

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:24.058

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.578
and felt that people were coming into their home.

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.058
Nihilistic delusions are when you feel

that things are senseless

i have also worked with many patients to heal their anxiety without medications

00:00:15.396 --> 00:00:20.226
it here are five supplements that can be very helpful in treating anxiety

00:00:20.227 --> 00:00:23.249
no 1 omega three fatty acids

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.799
multiple studies have found that omega three fatty acids can significantly produce anxiety

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.636
possibly through their effects on dopa mean and serotonin

00:00:31.637 --> 00:00:36.796
i recommend taking two to 3g of total omega three fatty acids daily

00:00:36.797 --> 00:00:42.102
with at least one gram of epa or two vitamin b 12

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.497
multiple studies have linked vitamin b 12 deficiency to anxiety

00:00:46.498 --> 00:00:51.601
and if your decision taking vitamin b 12 can significantly reduce anxiety

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.555
most people do better with metal cobalt as it's the more boo of fail before

00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:00.919
some people do better with sibling will be 12 and some people may need injections

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.169
no 3 magnesium

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.489
many studies have shown that magnesium can reduce anxiety

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.159
as it binds to gap over sectors and regulates the release of cortez

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.133
i recommend taking either magnesium glass in eight tour rate or three and eight

00:01:16.134 --> 00:01:20.785
and a good starting dose is 200 to 400mmg no

multiple studies have shown that healthy and is helpful for decreasing anxiety

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.879
via increasing gabba and enhancing alpha brainwaves

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.331
no 5 probiotics

00:01:46.332 --> 00:01:51.351
probiotics are found in fermented foods and are available in supplement form as well

studies have shown that probiotics can reduce anxiety

00:01:54.372 --> 00:01:59.627
likely due to increasing trip to fan and serotonin and reducing stress hormones

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.885

you can worry.

00:00:02.298 --> 00:00:04.217
But not all anxious people worry.

00:00:04.218 --> 00:00:07.177

So you have heart palpitations.

This is where you can

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.736
feel your heart beating in your chest. At rest,

00:00:16.763 --> 00:00:19.659
you should not feel your heart muscle contracting.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.682
If you do, it's palpitations,

00:00:21.683 --> 00:00:22.762
shortness of breath

00:00:22.763 --> 00:00:24.976
or feeling like you can't breathe.

00:00:25.098 --> 00:00:26.857
Lightheadedness or dizziness.

00:00:26.858 --> 00:00:29.337
You may feel that the room is getting dark

00:00:29.338 --> 00:00:31.697
or you're gonna lose consciousness in any moment.

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:33.017
Then there's weak legs,

00:00:33.018 --> 00:00:34.457
chest and back pressure.

00:00:34.458 --> 00:00:36.417
There's neck and shoulder pain.

00:00:36.418 --> 00:00:37.417
Then there's headaches

and heat coming from the top of your head and your ears.

00:00:40.578 --> 00:00:41.817
There's trouble swallowing.

00:00:41.818 --> 00:00:42.921
And then there's cloudy,

blurry, or tunnel vision.

This is the anxious brain,

00:00:01.301 --> 00:00:03.121
and this is the non anxious brain.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.940
Each piece represents an anxious thought.

00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:08.101
Both brains get the same thought.

00:00:08.102 --> 00:00:10.521
What if I eat something contaminated?

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.600
The anxious brain panics. It needs certainty.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.500
So it seeks reassurance, checking labels,

00:00:17.501 --> 00:00:19.541
researching food safety, asking others,

00:00:19.542 --> 00:00:22.201
maybe even avoiding certain foods altogether.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.920
And for a moment, the anxiety disappears.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.500
But here is the problem. It's not really gone.

00:00:29.501 --> 00:00:35.341
It's lingering. And now the brain has Learned uncertainty is dangerous.

00:00:35.342 --> 00:00:37.521
I need to do this again next time.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.060
So the anxiety grows. The next meal comes,

00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:44.901
the thought returns, what if this food is contaminated?

00:00:44.902 --> 00:00:47.561
The anxious brain reacts the same way.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.740
More checking, more researching,

00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:52.141
more avoiding. And it's gone.

00:00:52.142 --> 00:00:54.241
For now. But it returns,

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.080
stronger this time. And the anxiety keeps on growing.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.340
Each time you chase certainty,

00:01:00.341 --> 00:01:02.681
the brain reinforces the cycle.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.720
And before you know it, anxiety keeps growing higher and higher,

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.800
harder to control.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.580
Now let's look at the non anxious brain.

00:01:13.581 --> 00:01:17.841
It gets the same thought. What if I eat something contaminated?

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.340
But instead of chasing certainty,

00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:22.981
it responds with, I don't know.

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:24.341
Hopefully I don't get sick,

00:01:24.342 --> 00:01:27.581
but I don't know. It doesn't suppress it,

00:01:27.582 --> 00:01:30.941
it doesn't fight it. It just lets the thought be.

00:01:30.942 --> 00:01:33.521
So we're gonna put this piece right here.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.200
Another anxious thought, same response.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.840
And here is what is interesting,

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.880
because the non anxious brain isn't reinforcing the need for certainty.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.280
Over time, the pieces from the non Anxious brain

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.360
starts to unlearn the fear of uncertainty.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.360
The brain realizes uncertainty is part of life.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.640
Bad things could happen regardless of my interventions.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.800
And instead of anxiety growing,

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.340
it actually shrinks over time.

00:02:06.341 --> 00:02:08.621
You don't have to fear uncertainty.

00:02:08.622 --> 00:02:11.221

The story running in the brain

00:00:01.141 --> 00:00:04.041
is what actually causes continuous anxiety,

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.160
even when there's no danger around.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.660
So that was one thing I realized that was going on.

00:00:08.661 --> 00:00:11.321
And then I started to see that neurologically,

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.420
the opposite of anxiety seem to be creativity.

00:00:15.421 --> 00:00:18.661
If you look at the two parts of the brain that process that,

00:00:18.662 --> 00:00:22.381
they're kind of mirrors, and it seemed to me that they toggled.

00:00:22.382 --> 00:00:24.641
When one is on, the other goes off.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.500
We know that when anxiety comes up,

00:00:26.501 --> 00:00:31.221
creativity goes off. I decided to see if pushing creativity,

00:00:31.222 --> 00:00:33.261
active creativity of all kinds,

00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:37.361
not just like the arts, but literally making anything,

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.980
would shut down anxiety. And it turned out that it does.

00:00:41.981 --> 00:00:45.301
Your creativity is making,

00:00:45.302 --> 00:00:47.201
writing a card to a friend,

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.400
making a sandwich, inviting people to a dinner party,

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.980
thinking about how to arrange your furniture or wear your clothes.

00:00:53.981 --> 00:00:59.081
It. Everything you make or rearrange counts as creativity.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.920
So instead of thinking you have to do the creative arts,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.180
just make stuff. If you're worried about something,

00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:07.141
instead of thinking, what should I do?

00:01:07.142 --> 00:01:08.841
What should I do? Ask yourself,

what could I make right now?

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.300
And as you start to make it,

00:01:13.301 --> 00:01:14.861
even if you don't really want to,

00:01:14.862 --> 00:01:17.561
as you start to make that sandwich or whatever it is,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.420
for instance,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.500
get released into our bloodstream.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.640
One of the effects this has is either dilating

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.020
or constricting the blood vessels in our brain.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.080
One way this comes out as a symptom

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.200
is that it can cause migraines.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.520
Two gastro intestinal effects,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.000
GI effects, bloating

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.200
reflux, diarrhea,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.520
constipation.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.380
Sometimes people are diagnosed with IBS,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.900
and it's because of this.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.360
Now, same system,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.420
fight or flight. And again,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.760
picture in a jungle.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.980
Your fight or flight system is going off.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.400
If you're about to fight a bear or something

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.100
or run for your life,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.820
the last thing your body cares about is digesting food.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.480
The blood and everything gets shifted to your muscles.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.720
You start getting ready to fight or flee.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.200
And a lot of gastrointestinal symptoms can come up

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.240
because of that.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.160
Three. Brain fog

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.660
problems thinking.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.760
Anyone can relate to this.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.080
Being in some sort of social interaction

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.340
where you're nervous.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.440
Suddenly you can't string together a sentence,

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.780
and you can't even remember this person's name.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.320

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.960

 7 Terrible things 

00:00:00.987 --> 00:00:02.561
to say to someone with Depression

00:00:02.562 --> 00:00:05.001
Number 1 â€œYouâ€™re just looking for attentionâ€

00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:06.321
This is a complete myth

00:00:06.322 --> 00:00:08.341
People who are battling depression 

00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:09.901
often fight a silent battle

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.582
accusing them of seeking attention 

00:00:11.583 --> 00:00:12.961
invalidates their experiences

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:14.201
and can discourage them 

00:00:14.202 --> 00:00:15.081
from seeking help

00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:17.321
Number 2 â€œJust be Positiveâ€

00:00:17.322 --> 00:00:19.442
telling someone to just be positive 

00:00:19.443 --> 00:00:20.266
overlooks the 

00:00:20.267 --> 00:00:21.681
complexity of depression

00:00:21.682 --> 00:00:23.130
telling someone to just be more 

00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:24.761
positive and validates their emotion

00:00:24.762 --> 00:00:26.641
and the depression can actually grow

00:00:26.642 --> 00:00:29.841
Number 3 â€œEveryone feels that way sometimesâ€

00:00:29.842 --> 00:00:31.921
Depression is much more intense and 

00:00:31.922 --> 00:00:34.001
lasting more than normal mood swings

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:35.369
making this comparison can 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.281
be very misleading

00:00:36.282 --> 00:00:38.295
it can make someone who's feeling 

00:00:38.296 --> 00:00:39.480
depressed feel very 

00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:41.021
misunderstood and isolated

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.760
Number 4 â€œOther people have it worse than youâ€

00:00:43.761 --> 00:00:45.154
Comparing people struggle 

00:00:45.155 --> 00:00:46.601
dismisses the person's pain

00:00:46.602 --> 00:00:47.780
then someone who's feeling 

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:49.222
depressed may start experiencing 

00:00:49.223 --> 00:00:50.881
guilt for feeling depressed

00:00:50.882 --> 00:00:51.431
Number 5 

00:00:51.432 --> 00:00:54.001
â€œWhy don't you just try doing something fun?â€

00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:56.201
Depression drains energy and motivation

00:00:56.202 --> 00:00:57.623
and fun activities can 

00:00:57.624 --> 00:00:58.861
seem really daunting

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.398
this suggestion can add 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:01.601
unintended pressure

00:01:01.602 --> 00:01:04.241
Number 6 â€œYou just need to get out moreâ€

00:01:04.242 --> 00:01:05.481
for someone who's feeling depressed

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:07.521
socializing can be very overwhelming

00:01:07.522 --> 00:01:09.779
it's vital to be patient and not push 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.681
someone who's depressed too hard

00:01:11.682 --> 00:01:12.584
and Number 7

00:01:12.585 --> 00:01:15.221
 â€œI was depressed too for a few daysâ€

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.338

So what is high functioning depression now

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.040
depression doesn't start

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.480
the day you can't get out of bed

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.720
in reality very few people

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.220
suddenly become debilitated by depression

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.240
mostly that builds up over years of struggling to keep

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.400
your head above the water

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.440
while meeting all of life's expectations

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.280
at the same time

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.760
so you can be deeply suffering

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.480
with the symptoms of depression

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.080
even though you're still getting by

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.960
doing everything that you're supposed to do

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.860
that's why it's called high functioning depression

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.080
because outwardly

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.720
everyone can see how well you're coping with life

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.280
so we can be even harder to tell anyone

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.920
because you feel this deep shame

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.920
and you can't imagine how anyone would even believe you

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.040
so your suffering stays silent

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.000
but high functioning is not the same as happy

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.940
and healthy

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.740
the term high functioning is not a clinical diagnosis

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.460
but depression is

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.720
and the fact that you can make it to work or

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.180
school every day

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.040
does not mean that

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.820

People think of anxiety as something inside their head.

00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:04.041
That's not right.

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:07.201
You're anxious when everything around you is coming apart.

00:00:07.202 --> 00:00:09.001
The anxiety is a reflection of that.

there are several other symptoms of depression that we look for

00:00:12.281 --> 00:00:15.300
here are five of them No. 1 fatigue

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.760
also known as energia many people with depression

00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:20.600
notice that their energy levels significantly decrease

00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:22.380
during a period of depression

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.720
No.2 reduced interest

00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:26.640
another symptom is that when people become depressed

00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:30.620
they lose interest in the activities that they would usually enjoy doing

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.880
the depression takes away the sense of fulfilment from doing those activities

00:00:33.881 --> 00:00:36.360
so people no longer have the motivation to do them

00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:38.700
No. 3 inappropriate guilt

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.680
when people's depression is particularly severe

00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:41.960
they can start to feel guilty

00:00:41.961 --> 00:00:44.760
about things that they really shouldn't feel guilty about

00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:47.640
in particular people with depression can feel guilty about the impact

00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:50.600
that their illness is having on other people

00:00:50.601 --> 00:00:52.980
and this can lead to worsening of the depression

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.240
No.4 trouble concentrating

00:00:55.241 --> 00:00:56.640
when people are particularly depressed

00:00:56.641 --> 00:00:58.680
their ability to focus on education

00:00:58.681 --> 00:01:00.960
work and other activities can diminish

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:03.600
to the point where they're no longer able to function well

00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:06.520
and No. 5 thoughts of not wanting to be alive

00:01:06.521 --> 00:01:09.280
in severe depression people can feel like a burden to other people

00:01:09.281 --> 00:01:10.760
and they can have thoughts or feelings

00:01:10.761 --> 00:01:13.520
that things would be better if they were no longer alive

This is a brain without Depression

00:00:01.841 --> 00:00:04.080
and this is a brain with Depression

00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:05.565
Think of each Jenga piece as 

00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.000
someone's emotional capacity,

00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:08.940
their ability to handle challenges

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.800
When life throws difficult moments at you,

00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:12.780
it's like pulling a piece out

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.756
Let's see how this plays out for the 

00:00:14.757 --> 00:00:15.700
Non-Depressed brain

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.480
First, they have a hard day at work,

00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:20.657
a coworker shows up really late to an 

00:00:20.658 --> 00:00:22.891
important meeting, frustrating, sure!

00:00:22.892 --> 00:00:24.220
Let's take a peace out

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.460
Next. they spill coffee on their shirt

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.883
that is super annoying!

00:00:30.884 --> 00:00:32.780
so let's take another piece out

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.000
Then, there's no gas at a gas station

00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:41.492
it's really inconvenient, so let's 

00:00:41.493 --> 00:00:43.060
take another piece out

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.629
Finally, they find out a family member 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.080
won't be spending the holidays with them,

00:00:51.081 --> 00:00:52.880
that is super disappointing,

00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:55.140
so let's take another piece out

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.880
But see, even with those pieces taken out,

00:01:00.881 --> 00:01:02.960
their foundation is still strong,

00:01:02.961 --> 00:01:04.540
they can keep going

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.254
Now, let's see how these same events 

00:01:06.255 --> 00:01:07.720
play out for the depressed brain

00:01:07.721 --> 00:01:09.560
and since Depression is a disability,

00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:12.080
it means the person starts with fewer pieces,

00:01:12.081 --> 00:01:14.900
which makes small challenges feel overwhelming

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.056
A coworker shows up late to an 

00:01:17.057 --> 00:01:18.680
important meeting frustrating

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:26.497
that is super annoying!

00:01:26.498 --> 00:01:28.580
so let's take another piece out

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.960
Next, there's no gas at the gas station

00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:37.763
it's inconvenient, so let's 

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:39.180
take another piece out

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.097
Finally,  they find out that their family 

00:01:48.098 --> 00:01:50.400
won't be spending the holidays with them

00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:52.320
That is super disappointing,

00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:54.900
so let's take another piece out,

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.875
a brain with Depression just 

00:02:00.876 --> 00:02:02.680
doesn't have the same foundation

00:02:02.681 --> 00:02:04.635
this is what Non-Depressed people 

00:02:04.636 --> 00:02:06.491
often don't understand, they ask:

00:02:06.492 --> 00:02:09.220

13 signs your mental health is worsening

00:00:02.241 --> 00:00:03.136
#1 Poor sleep 

00:00:03.137 --> 00:00:04.800
You used to get good sleep,

harder on yourself

25,drt_therapist,Dr. T - Psychologist,https://www.tiktok.com/@drt_therapist,"00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.709
""How can I help my partner dealing with depression?""

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.189
I'm a psychologist and I'm going to give you a few pointers

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.669
First one is that depression shows up differently for different people

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.229
Sometimes it looks very irritable and moody

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.029
Sometimes it looks very sad

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.109
Sometimes it's very isolative

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.629
It's important to ask your partner what it is that they need help with

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.559
Some people will tell you what they need

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.059
Some people will feel really guilty and not want to burden you

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.279
and some people will insist that they are fine

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.420
It's important to respect what someone says

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.788
it's also important to continue to check in with them

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.230
whether that's via text

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:35.430
phone calls or in person

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:38.319
your person will tell you what they are most comfortable with

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.628
but when someone is depressed

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.470
they tend to isolate and really lose connection with the rest of the world

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:46.870
and sometimes as a result of that people forget to check in on them (forget emotional check ins especially)

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.231
That's such an important thing

to feel like you still matter to someone else

00:00:51.032 --> 00:00:54.271
if you know your person really well and what would be helpful for them

00:00:54.272 --> 00:00:57.511
you can offer to help them with things that maybe they're struggling with

00:00:57.512 --> 00:01:00.351
or that you know that they tend to lean on you for

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:03.587
things like helping to clean up a space, ""with their permissions""

00:01:03.907 --> 00:01:04.952
bringing food

00:01:05.187 --> 00:01:07.186
and maybe even finding a therapist

00:01:07.187 --> 00:01:08.091
because let's face it

00:01:08.092 --> 00:01:08.992
unfortunately

00:01:09.227 --> 00:01:11.150
it's a real challenge to find someone 

00:01:11.151 --> 00:01:11.859
something else

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.232
that's really important is to open the door to the conversation of

00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:17.599
if you're ever feeling really helpless or hopeless

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.506

00:01:19.507 --> 00:01:20.466

00:01:20.467 --> 00:01:21.960
please tell me

00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:23.680
make it so that's not a taboo subject

00:01:23.681 --> 00:01:25.618
because the truth is that

00:01:25.721 --> 00:01:28.738
people think about death and dying a lot more than we know

00:01:28.761 --> 00:01:30.720
they just don't talk about it quite as much

00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:32.800
and if someone is really struggling with depression

00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:35.858
you want them to know it is okay for them to talk about it

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.466
IF they choose to do so

00:01:37.513 --> 00:01:38.512
Those are just a few

00:01:38.513 --> 00:01:41.792

But if you go in and you talk to your doctor about having anxiety,

00:00:07.802 --> 00:00:09.921
at no point will they probably ask you,

00:00:09.922 --> 00:00:12.401

00:00:16.521 --> 00:00:20.141
Your mind doesn't do anything unless it has a purpose and a reason.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.640
So the purpose of anxiety is some sort of a call for an action.

00:00:25.641 --> 00:00:28.081
Your mind is getting you to be anxious

00:00:28.082 --> 00:00:31.181
because it's concerned about something.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.120
Most of the times, anxiety is the result of fear of the future,

00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:38.001
fear of something coming up.

00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:39.881

different lights coming in your brain.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.279

00:00:40.881 --> 00:00:48.760
that it just takes more effort to think and respond than you think is reasonable

00:00:48.761 --> 00:00:55.680
it is very common anxiety because your brain is so focused on negativity

00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:59.960
or depression where you don't have enough activity in your brain

00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:02.360
there's one type of depression

00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:06.720
I call it unfocused but there's really low activity in the brain

00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:10.120
commonly associated with brain fart

00:01:10.121 --> 00:01:10.720
again

00:01:10.721 --> 00:01:15.400
you wanna keep your brain healthy or rescue it if it's headed to the dark place

00:01:15.401 --> 00:01:19.400
you have to prevent or treat these risk factors I've been talking about

00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:20.560
so bright minds

00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:23.440
b is for blood flow r is retirement and aging

00:01:23.441 --> 00:01:26.360
I is inflammation G is genetics

00:01:26.361 --> 00:01:29.640
stuff like anxiety and depression run in families

00:01:29.641 --> 00:01:31.760
but are also the negative thinking

00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:37.120
the dysfunctional thinking patterns can also be modeled in families

00:01:37.121 --> 00:01:40.760
I often say genes are not a death sentence

00:01:40.761 --> 00:01:42.720
what they should be is a wake up call

00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:44.000
genes load the gun

00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:48.080
it's what happened to us in our behavior that pulls the trigger

00:01:48.081 --> 00:01:51.800
so if I know I have anxiety in my family

00:01:51.801 --> 00:01:56.360
then I'm gonna work even harder to prevent the age

00:01:56.361 --> 00:01:57.160
in right minds

00:01:57.161 --> 00:02:02.200
is head trauma a major cause of psychiatric problems that nobody knows about

00:02:02.201 --> 00:02:06.120
because most psychiatrist actually never look at the brain

00:02:06.121 --> 00:02:13.080
actually have a database of 160,000 scans on patients from 155 countries

00:02:13.081 --> 00:02:14.240
and if you said hey Daniel

00:02:14.241 --> 00:02:16.160
single most important thing you Learned

00:02:16.161 --> 00:02:19.760
from the world's largest brain image and database related to psychiatry

00:02:19.761 --> 00:02:22.240
I would say mild traumatic brain injuries

00:02:22.241 --> 00:02:24.520
major cause of psychiatric problems

00:02:24.521 --> 00:02:27.280
if you don't get the right diagnosis

00:02:27.281 --> 00:02:30.400
you'll never end up with the right treatment plan

00:02:30.401 --> 00:02:33.760
the t in bright minds is for toxins

00:02:33.761 --> 00:02:36.440

Number 7

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:06.201
Whenever you have pain in your chest

00:00:06.202 --> 00:00:08.394
Your mind automatically thinks that 

00:00:08.395 --> 00:00:10.101

Any pain in your body

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.335

all of your symptoms

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.800
and when you read

everything that's on Google

00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:21.541
It makes your Anxiety much worse

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.457
Number 5 

00:00:22.458 --> 00:00:24.309
You're constantly going to the 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.041
hospital to check if you have

00:00:26.042 --> 00:00:28.061
Any physical conditions

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.328
Even when all the doctors 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.501
reassure you, you still keep going back

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.132
Number 4

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.696
You're constantly worrying 

00:00:35.697 --> 00:00:36.681
About your Health

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:38.701
Especially if nobody's there

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.824
This is because you believe that there 

00:00:40.825 --> 00:00:42.521

00:00:42.522 --> 00:00:44.741

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.780
Number 3

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.540
You are constantly scanning your body

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.649
Your mind is hyper vigilant to any 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.324
physical sensations

Number 2

of people who were perfectly healthy

00:00:58.522 --> 00:00:59.851
And all of the sudden 

00:00:59.852 --> 00:01:01.181
they lost their health

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.274

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.097
Number 1

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:07.841
You  avoid doing meaningful activities

00:01:07.842 --> 00:01:09.574

Treating social anxiety.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.480
Doctor Mike Ma. Here,

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.880
guys. Now here.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.120
I'm talking about clinically significant social anxiety.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.880
That often includes a lifetime of fear

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.260
avoidance behavior,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.040
resulting in loneliness,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.880
oftentimes depression,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.180
and overall general anxiety.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.200
Now, how do I treat?

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.260
My plan usually includes starting an SSRM medication.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.240
Zoloft, Prozac,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.740
Lexapro, whatever,

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.860
which is the first line treatment for anxiety disorders.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.680
I will then set them up with a skilled CBT therapist

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.320
that will put them through a series of exposures

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.740
so they can face their fears.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.440
Now, they do it in a tiered fashion.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.960
They don't just throw you in so you panic.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.960
That would be counterproductive.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.700
They do it in a systematic way.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.800
Sometimes I will also give patients

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.640
an as needed medication,

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.360
like a beta block or like

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.580
a propranolol.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.360
That will help relieve

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.940
a lot of the physical symptoms of anxiety

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.540
that they might experience when they socialize.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.140
That is often helpful for that socially anxious person

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.840
whose heart starts racing.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.120
They get sweaty.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.040
Sweaty. They start trembling,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.000
and then they feel like other people notice that,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.160
and then it's a positive feedback loop

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.380
that gets them even more anxious.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.260
So that's my general treatment plan for social anxiety.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.040
Obviously, it is individualized per person,

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.539

The United States.

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.340
One of the ways that we define depression

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.460
is an inadequate supply of serotonin.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.200
Now remember,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.400
with regard to serotonin,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.440
which is how many of us, um.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.120
And, and in the medical community define depression.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.900
If you have low serotonin,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.200
then question is,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.840
where is serotonin made?

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.360
Where do we get serotonin?

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.720
You can't just eat a serotonin sandwich.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.280
There are not serotonin capsules that you can take

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.040
to magically raise your serotonin.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600
Serotonin is a neurotransmitter

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.700
that is actually methylated in the gut.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.180
Remember, 90% of the serotonin in your body is here,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.000
so if you don't have it here,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.420
you can't have it here.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.880
Which is often why

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.160
depression does not begin in our outside environment

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.880
through a cluster of symptoms.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.340
It actually begins right here in our gut

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.740
through a process called methylation.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.480
There are genetic tests you can do

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.760
to see if your methylation is working properly.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.440
Or you can look to supplement

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.000
for some of the key nutrients

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.680
that are very often linked to depressive symptoms.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.760
So it's not just that you need to supplement, cause I,

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.880
I find that a lot of people just supplement

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.120
for the sake of supplementing.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.560
We need to supplement with the methylated

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.760
forms of vitamins,

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.860

Most people think social anxiety 

00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:03.560
looks like avoiding people

00:00:03.561 --> 00:00:05.120

even quick conversations because the fear 

00:00:09.161 --> 00:00:11.540
of judgement feels unbearable

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.320
But here is what's not talked about enough:

00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:17.120
Some people with social anxiety do the opposite,

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:18.537
they overcompensate

00:00:18.538 --> 00:00:19.028
They develop  

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.080
incredible social skills, not because they're confident,

00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:24.380
but because they're terrified of being judged

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.680
They micromanage their tone, expressions, 

00:00:26.681 --> 00:00:28.220
every little interaction,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.960
On the outside? They seem outgoing

00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:34.320
But inside? Theyâ€™re over analyzing everything

00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:36.440
The problem is, avoiding embarrassment 

00:00:36.441 --> 00:00:39.100
and judgement can't be your life strategy

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.440
We know exposure is an evidence based 

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:43.160
treatment for social anxiety

00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:44.760
That means two things:

00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:45.360
Number 1

00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:47.320
You gotta face the uncertainty of judgement

00:00:47.321 --> 00:00:50.600
Instead of trying to guarantee you won't be judged, 

00:00:50.601 --> 00:00:52.480
you learn to accept that no matter what,

00:00:52.481 --> 00:00:54.740
it's always gonna be a possibility,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.440
no matter what you do

00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:57.120
You may be watching this video and 

00:00:57.121 --> 00:00:59.480
judging it positively, negatively, or 

00:00:59.481 --> 00:01:01.020
may have no opinion on it,

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.260
I don't know how it's gonna be perceived

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.220
And that's exactly the point

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.960
Number 2 

00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:08.060
You gotta engage in gradual exposure

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.320
Push yourself into social situations,

00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:12.740
but stay until the anxiety drops

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.880
That part is crucial

00:01:13.881 --> 00:01:16.840
If you leave too soon? you reinforce the fear, 

00:01:16.841 --> 00:01:17.820
But if you stay?

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.160
Your brain starts learning something different:

00:01:20.161 --> 00:01:22.560

5 things not to Do When You Have Depression.

00:00:06.152 --> 00:00:10.441
One don't believe every stupid thing you think.

00:00:10.538 --> 00:00:15.457
Depression increases negativity and the ants.

00:00:15.458 --> 00:00:17.257
The automatic negative thoughts

00:00:17.258 --> 00:00:20.297
jump on you and invest you.

00:00:20.298 --> 00:00:22.839
And how you kill the ants is you write them down.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.121
You go, is that true?

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.157
You have to nudge your brain to be positive,

00:00:28.158 --> 00:00:31.021
not just give in to the negative.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.779
I was depressed.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.975
I wouldn't stay in bed.

00:00:33.976 --> 00:00:36.164
Actually, our research shows

00:00:36.416 --> 00:00:38.764
that when you just stay in bed,

00:00:39.256 --> 00:00:40.844
you get more depressed.

00:00:41.016 --> 00:00:44.015
But by getting up and becoming active

00:00:44.016 --> 00:00:46.004
and distracting yourself,

00:00:46.056 --> 00:00:47.724
activates your brain,

00:00:47.856 --> 00:00:50.644
and you begin to feel much better.

00:00:50.845 --> 00:00:54.004
I would never self medicate

00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:56.433
with things like alcohol or marijuana

00:00:56.434 --> 00:01:01.414
that depress brain function and actually make you worse.

00:01:01.485 --> 00:01:06.254
Um, I would never just take any antidepressant.

00:01:06.325 --> 00:01:08.862
Um, depression is like chest pain.

00:01:08.863 --> 00:01:11.363
There's so many different causes.

00:01:11.576 --> 00:01:13.083
I prescribe medicine,

00:01:13.296 --> 00:01:16.683
but I do it to your brain type.

00:01:16.768 --> 00:01:18.247

00:01:18.248 --> 00:01:19.899

And if I was depressed,

00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:28.325
I never give up hope.

00:01:28.326 --> 00:01:32.485
Depression is a very treatable group.

00:01:32.486 --> 00:01:33.579
It's not one thing,

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.401
but group of illnesses

00:01:36.938 --> 00:01:38.719
that people get better.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.737
And sometimes people have really dark thoughts

00:01:40.738 --> 00:01:43.200
and they give up hope.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.979
And there's so much hope.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.600
What we've seen here at Amon Clinics

here are three signs of hidden depression

00:00:02.561 --> 00:00:04.481
as a doctor I see most often

00:00:04.482 --> 00:00:05.521
I'm Doctor A

00:00:05.522 --> 00:00:07.181
a GP based in the UK

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.940
and here are three signs I see that you may not think are linked to depression

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.520
but can be now

00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:14.881
people with high functioning or hidden depression

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:18.181
can do all their activities and carry on with everyday lives as normal

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.280
and as a doctor

00:00:19.281 --> 00:00:20.241
this can be quite worrying

00:00:20.242 --> 00:00:21.881
because when people have depression

00:00:21.882 --> 00:00:24.001
that's obvious that they're feeling sad all the time

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:25.401
at least you can diagnose it

00:00:25.402 --> 00:00:26.241
with hidden depression

00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:30.141
it can go undiagnosed for many years and then get bad very quickly

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.280
No. 1 is just feeling numb

00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:33.241
so you don't feel happy

00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:34.001
you don't feel sad

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:35.141
you just feel nothing

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.220
whether it should be a joyous occasion or a sad occasion

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.280
your emotions are just plateaued and you don't feel anything

00:00:42.281 --> 00:00:43.961
No. 2 is quite common one actually

00:00:43.962 --> 00:00:46.101
and it's physical symptoms without a cause

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.280
so this might be things like aches and pains

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:49.161
stomach pains

00:00:49.162 --> 00:00:50.561
feeling sick or dizzy

00:00:50.562 --> 00:00:54.101
the key thing to know is that nothing generally has changed in lifestyle

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.880
and there's no medical cause to explain the symptoms

00:00:56.881 --> 00:00:59.461
and finally No. 3 is coping mechanisms

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.040
now this can be very hard to spot

00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:03.101
and some people may say it's actually a good thing

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.860
but people with hidden depression or high functioning depression

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.480
tend to do things to cope with how they're feeling

00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:10.321
so this might be taking up a new hobby

00:01:10.322 --> 00:01:12.021
or doing a hobby excessively

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.140
such as running

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.180
or may manifest as alcohol or drug abuse

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.480
now this is important to know

00:01:17.481 --> 00:01:20.381
because if the underlying cause is the depression

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.060
this needs to be diagnosed

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.200
because eventually

00:01:23.201 --> 00:01:25.881
the coping mechanisms may work for a while

00:01:25.882 --> 00:01:27.821
but there's risk they may stop working

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.240
and the depression will overflow and get bad very quickly

00:01:31.241 --> 00:01:33.281
so yeah I just think more people need to be aware

00:01:33.282 --> 00:01:36.701
that depression isn't always just the person looking sad all the time

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.100
it can be quite hidden

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.640
and it can manifest in same different ways

00:01:40.641 --> 00:01:43.041

Most things in life are on a continuum.

00:00:22.507 --> 00:00:26.192
And if you can rate things from on a scale 0-10,

00:00:26.387 --> 00:00:28.626
you'll see things a little more realistically

OK, I'll continue to answer.

00:00:01.381 --> 00:00:03.333
Another question that stopped by in the comment section.

00:00:03.334 --> 00:00:04.586
About mental health issues.

00:00:04.587 --> 00:00:05.117
Remember him.

00:00:05.118 --> 00:00:07.671
not a substitute for a doctor's professional judgment

00:00:07.936 --> 00:00:10.126
Just to increase our knowledge.

00:00:10.127 --> 00:00:11.509
What is a disease?

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:12.463
mental illness

00:00:12.616 --> 00:00:15.823
Can the doctor explain social anxiety?

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.227
OK, 

00:00:17.227 --> 00:00:18.135
yes.

00:00:18.136 --> 00:00:21.379
Social anxiety is a disease.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.607
under the category of anxiety disorder

00:00:23.785 --> 00:00:25.620
There are many anxiety disorders.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.413
One of them is social anxiety disorder.

00:00:28.414 --> 00:00:30.959
so social anxiety disorder refers to

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.319
Individuals with anxiety disorders.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.001
extreme anxiety

00:00:39.247 --> 00:00:43.501
specifically triggered by social situations.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.369
What does this social situation mean?

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.739
when he is faced with the atmosphere

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.200
Where will he meet?

00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:51.673
Or meet people.

00:00:52.006 --> 00:00:54.476
So it could be because he's afraid.

00:00:54.806 --> 00:00:56.448
People will judge him.

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:57.333
For example, 

00:00:57.333 --> 00:01:00.393
in the context of a performance presentation.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.617
work meeting and so on

00:01:02.618 --> 00:01:05.666
Or simply an ordinary meeting.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.396
but he worries later

00:01:07.397 --> 00:01:10.446
He will feel threatened or unsafe.

00:01:10.447 --> 00:01:12.804
Because of the existence of people.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.114
The existence of others.

00:01:14.421 --> 00:01:16.839
so he can be afraid to go to the store

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.149
He is afraid to talk to people near the counter.

00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:21.189
He is afraid to go to Friday prayers.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.949
He is afraid of crowded places.

00:01:23.241 --> 00:01:26.338
Why does he think he doesn't?

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.389
survived in that situation.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.507
People will judge him.

00:01:29.552 --> 00:01:32.467
Or he will do something that will embarrass him.

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:35.027
which will make others look at him strangely.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.075
When this situation occurs.

00:01:38.325 --> 00:01:39.579
What will he feel?

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.315
he will feel palpitations

00:01:41.645 --> 00:01:42.889
feeling sweaty

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.015
It feels shaky.

00:01:44.305 --> 00:01:45.159
I don't feel good, 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.137
my head starts thinking all kinds of things.

00:01:47.465 --> 00:01:49.445
and what will happen is he will

00:01:49.446 --> 00:01:51.939
start to develop ovoidence behavior.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.369
So what does this virus behavior mean?

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.789
he will avoid

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.222
Than going through that situation.

00:01:57.223 --> 00:01:59.946
Or he will hurry up and stay now.

00:01:59.947 --> 00:02:02.069
We just call this social anxiety disorder.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.123
If first.

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:03.357
..

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.206
he lasted more than six months

00:02:06.207 --> 00:02:07.929
Continuously.

00:02:08.051 --> 00:02:10.309
The second is not due to other problems.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.847
not because he has depression

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.444
It's not because he hears voices.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.707
Not because of other health problems.

00:02:17.112 --> 00:02:17.967
And the third.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.856
That thing.

00:02:18.857 --> 00:02:20.804
Happens to the point of disturbing, 

00:02:20.804 --> 00:02:22.373
it has a disturbing function.

00:02:22.486 --> 00:02:23.809
It has functionality.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.716
so if we think the answer is a little scary,

00:02:25.746 --> 00:02:26.940
But we can still do it.

00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:28.739
We dare to do it too.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.933
He can settle.

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:31.616
Please help me adjust the order.

00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:33.970
so if we experience what I just said,

00:02:33.971 --> 00:02:35.213
What we need to do is

00:02:35.214 --> 00:02:36.976
We need to get a doctor's evaluation.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.875
We will confirm whether it is correct.

00:02:38.876 --> 00:02:41.464
We have social media soda and we'll take care of it.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.096
so his treatment is in two forms.

00:02:43.097 --> 00:02:45.364
an original pharmacy for treatment in the form of medicine

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.030
to reduce our anxiety

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:48.629
The second is in the form of therapy.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.629
to retrain back we have a mind

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.553
the way we deal with the situation.

00:02:52.746 --> 00:02:56.430

So what are signs of depression that might not be obvious

00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:08.760
so being sad or blue

00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:09.960
that's obvious

00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:12.020
having unaliving thoughts

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.180
again that's obvious

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.880
having memory problems is actually a sign of depression

00:00:18.881 --> 00:00:22.860
or can be having low energy

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.280
waking up in the middle of the night unhappy

00:00:27.281 --> 00:00:31.140
and not being able to go back to sleep

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.400
um losing your appetite

and losing a fair amount of weight for little or no reason you're not trying

00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:41.640

is is another sign that people don't think about and having trouble concentrate

now how do you distinguish between ADHD and depression

00:00:58.481 --> 00:01:04.480
um the trouble concentrating only happens during the depressive episodes

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:05.720

in order for you to overcome anxiety symptoms.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.860
First of all,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.519
get yourself up of the situation,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.940
take a step back.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.079
Then get a hot water.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.340
It could be coffee,

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.060
tea or even just plain water.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.839
Now focus on the hot water

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.679
and you know it's hot.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.919
Therefore you need to shift

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.580
and be mindful about the hot.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.980
You need to blow it cause it's really hot.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.860
Slowly sip the coffee or water.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.340

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.079
Now you can repeat this over and over again

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.660
until you are more settled and more more calm,

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.860
more relaxed.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.900

Four signs you might be struggling with both high functioning anxiety and depression

00:00:05.408 --> 00:00:07.787
one a part of you doesn't care about anything at all

00:00:07.788 --> 00:00:08.411
while another

00:00:08.412 --> 00:00:12.572
part of you cares about every single little thing that's ever happened in your entire life

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.658
two you might be so exhausted that it's hard to get out of bed or take a shower

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:17.229
but you also

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.260
might feel so restless and so keyed up that it's hard to sit still or stop doing things

00:00:22.299 --> 00:00:23.529
three you have

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.703
zero motivation to get anything done but you also have this crippling fear of failure

00:00:27.704 --> 00:00:30.954
and worry that if you don't do the thing something bad will happen

00:00:30.984 --> 00:00:34.149
and four you're lonely and desperately want connection but

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.423
the thought of socializing either feels too overwhelming or just too scary so you either

00:00:38.424 --> 00:00:42.032
make plans and then cancel or just avoid making plans all together

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.204
having one of these is hard having both can feel impossible and confusing

5 things I would never do as a psychiatrist now for over 40 years

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.799
I would never believe every stupid thing I think

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.580
you need to learn how to direct and control your thoughts

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.919
I would never ever say everything I think

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.319
I know a lot of people go I'm brutally honest

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.860
that means your frontal lobes aren't working right

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.660
3 and never stay up late because when you don't sleep

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.599
sleep your brain cleans and washes itself trash builds up

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.460
and then you begin to think like garbage

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.159
I would never eat everything I want

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.839
my grandfather was a candy maker

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.879
and so I have a sweet tooth

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:58.679
but I know the quality of my brain health is directly related to the food I eat

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.719
and I would never just take medication my psychiatrist or doctor prescribed

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.439
without trying to research it and do natural things

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.599
first medication changes your brain to need it in order for you to feel normal

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.580
now I'm not opposed to medicine

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.380
sometimes it can save people's lives

10 signs your mental health is worsening 

00:00:04.463 --> 00:00:07.560
1  you feel low in mood most of the day

00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:11.980
for most days nothing helps to lift your mood or cheer you up

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.240
2  you are not enjoying life as much as you used to

00:00:16.241 --> 00:00:20.080
or there can be no joy in your life whatsoever

00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:21.800
nothing excites you anymore

00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:26.020
and activities that were once pleasurable no longer are

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.560
3 reduced energy and motivation

00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:31.380
you can experience mental

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.360
physical and emotional exhaustion

00:00:34.361 --> 00:00:37.620
your mind and body are completely drained

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.040
you don't even have the energy to get out of bed

00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:45.060
let alone tidy it four oversleeping or undersleeping

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.520
your sleep is often interrupted and when you do get some sleep

00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:53.100
it is not restorative and you still feel tired

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.600
5 appetite changes

00:00:55.601 --> 00:00:58.280
this can either be overeating or undereating

00:00:58.281 --> 00:01:01.840
and is often associated with weight gain or weight loss

00:01:01.841 --> 00:01:04.500
which can be rapid and substantial

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.840
6 getting annoyed

00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:11.080
at others easily things never used to affect you so much

00:01:11.081 --> 00:01:15.500
whereas now you notice you are more reactive and snappy

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.800
7 concentration difficulties and memory problems

00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:24.200
especially short term memory problems resulting in careless mistakes

00:01:24.201 --> 00:01:27.300
getting lost easily and misplacing items

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.640
8 social withdrawal and isolation when once you were outgoing

00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:35.320
extrovert and you would socialise often

00:01:35.321 --> 00:01:37.820
you have become increasingly withdrawn

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.100
and you have stopped accepting invitations for social events and activities

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.160
9 self neglect when once you would take great pride in your appearance

00:01:49.161 --> 00:01:50.980
now you've let yourself go

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.800
your personal hygiene is not as good as it used to be

00:01:54.801 --> 00:01:58.480
and even your clothes can be covered in stains

00:01:58.481 --> 00:02:01.240
and 10 hopelessness

00:02:01.241 --> 00:02:03.240
when someone asks you about the future

00:02:03.241 --> 00:02:09.200
for example you can feel so hopeless and believe that things will never change

00:02:09.201 --> 00:02:12.240
and that you have no future

00:02:12.241 --> 00:02:14.800
okay if you do notice any of these signs or symptoms

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:17.040
I would urge you to seek professional help

00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:19.760
from a family doctor and or a psychiatrist

The symptoms of major depressive disorder can be severe and debilitating

00:00:06.201 --> 00:00:10.000
they include insomnia reduced energy and motivation

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:13.160
hopelessness and worthlessness and excessive guilt

00:00:13.161 --> 00:00:18.840
which can immobilize you no pleasure in life pervasively and persistently

00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:22.900
low mood and weight gain which can be substantial

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.580
the worst symptom of depression really does depend on the individual

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.420
and how it affects them and their functioning and their quality of life

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.920
but for me at least one of the worst symptoms

00:00:35.921 --> 00:00:39.500
if not the worst symptom is rumination

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.920
that is when you go over a certain event or experience

00:00:43.921 --> 00:00:49.620
usually traumatic again and again and again

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.380
like a broken record player in your mind

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.220
you have no control over this

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.020
the traumatic memory automatically resurfaces and is recurrent

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.820
intrusive and distressing

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.780
It is the last thing you think about before you fall asleep

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.440
that is if you are lucky enough to get some sleep

00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:13.740
because the rumination can keep you up

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.220
it's also the first thing you think about when you wake up in the morning

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.660
it's really horrible and I don't think it's spoken about enough

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.540
it is a depressive symptom

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.580
but it can also be a trauma response

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.280
in theory if you treat the underlying major depressive disorder

00:01:37.281 --> 00:01:40.200
then the rumination should settle

00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:41.860
at least to a degree

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.640
so I would seriously consider taking antidepressant medication

00:01:46.641 --> 00:01:49.240
like sertraline or Zoloft

00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:52.000
for example that being said

00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:56.980
I would personally recommend talking to a psychotherapist

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.620
and receiving trauma informed care

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:08.380
unless you process that unresolved trauma where the rumination is stemming from

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.220
and understand and unpack

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.940
why the traumatic event and experience had such a devastating effect on you

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.300
it will continue to lurk and linger in your unconscious mind

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.900
the traumatic event and experience will haunt you like a malevolent ghost

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.940
and negatively influence your mental health

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.640
functioning and interpersonal relationships

Five things not to do when you have depression.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.820
One, don't believe every stupid thing you think.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.860
Depression increases negativity

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.800
and the ants.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.560
The automatic negative thoughts,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.640
jump on you and invest you.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.200
And how you kill the ants is you write them down.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.380
You go, is that true?

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.440
You have to nudge your brain to be positive,

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.420
not just give in to the negative.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.160
Um, I was depressed.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.880
I wouldn't stay in bed. Actually,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.260
our research shows that when you just stay in bed,

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.220
you get more depressed.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.360
But by getting up and becoming active

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.360
and distracting yourself,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.100
activate your brain,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.900
and you begin to feel much better.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.320
I would never self medicate

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.720
with things like alcohol or marijuana.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.880
That depressed brain function

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.820
and actually make you worse. Um,

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.580
I would never just take any antidepressant. Um,

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.120
depression is like chest pain.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.840
There's so many different causes.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.560
I prescribe medicine,

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.000
but I do it to your brain type.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.560
So you can read about my work

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.240
and learn about brain types.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.400

And if I was depressed,

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.680
I never give up hope.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.760
Depression is a very treatable,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.920
uh, grope. It's not one thing,

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.160
but grope of illnesses.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.080
That people get better.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.120
And sometimes people have really dark thoughts,

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.560
and they give up hope.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.240
And there's so much hope.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.440
What we've seen here at Amen Clinics is

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.680
people get better.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.520

six things a depressed person wants you to know 

00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:10.420
1 we did not decide to become depressed

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.820
in the same way that people don't decide to have other illnesses

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.180
like breast cancer or arthritis

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.340
we never wanted to become depressed

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.140
in fact we wouldn't want it for our worst enemy

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.580
2 we are not ignoring you when we don't get back to your calls emails

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.700
voicemails or messages

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.900
it's just we don't even have the energy to get out of bed

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.340
you did not do anything wrong

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.300
please don't take it personally

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.700
3 there doesn't necessarily have to be a trigger

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.180
or a reason for us to become depressed

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.780
depression can creep up on you from seemingly nowhere and for no apparent reason

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.340
depression can be cruel like that

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.420
four even though it might not seem like it or we don't say it

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.780
we appreciate all the time

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.140
effort and energy you put into checking up on us

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.620
5 often we withdraw and we isolate ourselves because we don't want you to get hurt

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.620
we know that we have become more snappy

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.240
short tempered angry

00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:32.340
and irritable and we don't want to lash out and take it out on you

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:42.020
and 6 we may have seemingly changed so much that we have become unrecognizable to you

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.500
but we are still the same person

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.300

Canceling plans at the last minute

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.091
Anxiety can feel overwhelming, making you 

00:00:07.092 --> 00:00:09.540
back out of commitments at the last second

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.082
You come up with excuses like â€œI'm not 

00:00:12.083 --> 00:00:14.100
feeling wellâ€ or â€œSomething came upâ€

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.420
but afterward, the guilt hits

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.261
You are wondering if they think 

00:00:18.262 --> 00:00:21.420
you're rude or unreliable and that worry lingers

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.300
Staring at your phone during social gatherings

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.647
Scrolling through your phone feels like a 

00:00:27.648 --> 00:00:29.680
safe escape from awkward conversations

00:00:29.681 --> 00:00:32.260
or the fear of saying the wrong thing

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.500
But while it protects you in the moment,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.437
it also isolates, you cutting you off from 

00:00:37.438 --> 00:00:39.540
genuine connections with others

Losing your temper when things don't go as planned

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.220
You've thought through every detail,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.520
and when something doesn't go as expected,

00:00:48.521 --> 00:00:51.500
it feels like the whole plan is falling apart

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.320
It's not just frustrating, it's overwhelming,

00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:56.813

00:00:56.814 --> 00:00:58.820
like everything is out of control

Procrastinating tasks until the very last minute

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.885
The thought of starting feels so 

00:01:04.886 --> 00:01:07.220
overwhelming that you avoid it completely

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.060
You push it off, hoping you'll feel more ready later,

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.700
but as the deadline looms,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.144

You anticipate every â€œwhat ifâ€ and try to prepare for it all

You overpack, rehearse conversations in your head,

00:01:26.121 --> 00:01:28.620
or spend hours double checking details

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.280
Silence feels unbearable, so you fill it,

line in a book or zoning out during

#1 You experience sudden emotional outbursts

00:00:05.241 --> 00:00:06.880
You hold everything inside until the 

00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:09.080
pressure builds up and then, boom! 

00:00:09.081 --> 00:00:10.800
something tiny sets you off

00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:13.480
It's not about that one moment, it's all the 

00:00:13.481 --> 00:00:15.100
emotions you've been avoiding

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.140
#2 You feel emotionally drained

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.680
Keeping your feelings bottled up is exhausting

00:00:20.681 --> 00:00:23.120
It's like running on empty everyday,

00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:26.180
because you never let yourself refill the tank

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.300
#3 You say ""I'm fine"" when you're clearly not

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.160
It's your automatic response even 

00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:33.560
when you're falling apart inside

00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:36.000
Saying ""I'm fine"" might make things 

00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:37.680
easier in the moment, but it only 

00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:39.140
adds to the loneliness

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.560
#4 You struggle with physical symptoms

00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:45.140
Your body knows what your mind is trying to ignore

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.080
Tight shoulders, constant headaches,

00:00:47.081 --> 00:00:49.440
or an upset stomach often signal that 

00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:51.580
you're holding in too much

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.220
#5 You're constantly busy

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.600
You bury yourself in work, errands or social plans

00:00:57.601 --> 00:01:00.700
thinking ""If I I stay busy, I won't have time to feel this""

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.540
But distraction doesn't equal healing

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.280
#6 You avoid conflict at all costs

00:01:06.281 --> 00:01:07.920
Even when you're hurt, you tell yourself

00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:09.100
""It's not worth it""

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.400
You avoid the fight, but you pay the price 

00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:14.020
in silent resentment and frustration

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.340
#7 You feel disconnected from yourself

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.040
When you try to bury your thoughts 

00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:20.340
and hide your feelings,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.200
you can start to question yourself,

00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:23.160

51,therapytothepoint,TherapyToThePoint,https://www.tiktok.com/@therapytothepoint,"00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.454
Number 5 You only show up to events 

00:00:04.455 --> 00:00:07.100
whenever you're at your best or close to it

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.960
You might even smile, laugh,

00:00:08.961 --> 00:00:11.020
and look like you're having a great time

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.766
But this is a problem because if 

00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:14.440
people only see you at your best

00:00:14.441 --> 00:00:16.089
They don't really know what is 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.580
going on beneath the surface

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.479
You're hiding the struggle to protect 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.520
how others perceive you,

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:22.940
but that silence is costing you

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.622
Number 4 When someone asks you 

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:26.740
how you're doing you say ""I'm good""

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.976
Even when you're not 

00:00:27.977 --> 00:00:30.360
You don't wanna burden anyone with the truth

00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:33.040
or risk the conversation getting too deep,

00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:34.920
so you keep it surface level,

00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:36.880
but each time you lie you pull further 

00:00:36.881 --> 00:00:38.840
away from the support you actually need

00:00:38.841 --> 00:00:40.680
Number 3 You numb your feelings

00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:41.960
whether it's with alcohol,

00:00:41.961 --> 00:00:44.980
food, or endlessly scrolling on your phone

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.600
It distracts you for a moment,

00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:48.564
but the emotions you're trying to 

00:00:48.565 --> 00:00:50.240
avoid only build up over time

00:00:50.241 --> 00:00:52.269
What feels like a relief is actually 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.080
making things worse in the long run

00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:55.580
Number 2 You're buying things 

00:00:55.581 --> 00:00:57.766
you don't need hoping that they'll give you 

00:00:57.767 --> 00:00:59.100
some kind of escape or joy,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.020
but after the purchase, you feel 

00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:02.000
emptier than before

00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:03.810
it's like you're trapped in a 

00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:05.440
cycle with no clear way out

00:01:05.441 --> 00:01:07.900
feeling more lost than ever before

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.770
and Number 1 Even though you're 

00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:12.085
forcing yourself to do things you once 

00:01:12.086 --> 00:01:14.460
enjoyed, the pleasure is no longer there

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.640
You may still show up,

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:17.067

Number 7 Only consuming short form content

00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:10.360
When you only watch quick, bite size content, 

00:00:10.361 --> 00:00:13.160
your attention span tends to shorten over time

00:00:13.161 --> 00:00:16.300
because your brain gets used to instant stimulation

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.780
Number 6 Using your phone in bed

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.869
Scrolling in bed creates an association 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.560
between your phone and sleep space,

00:00:23.561 --> 00:00:25.440
making it harder to fall asleep

00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:27.995
This disrupted sleep will take a toll on 

00:00:27.996 --> 00:00:29.740
your mental health over time

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.620
Number 5 Avoiding uncomfortable situations

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.840
Growth happens outside of your comfort zone

00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:37.640
If you constantly avoid challenges,

00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:39.680
you're missing out on personal growth

00:00:39.681 --> 00:00:42.420
which deep down impacts your mental health

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.540
Number 4 Constantly complaining about others

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.580
Yes, processing difficult relationships is important,

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.520
but if you're always complaining

00:00:51.521 --> 00:00:53.680
it's easy to get stuck in negativity

00:00:53.681 --> 00:00:55.940
This can distort how you see others

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.840
Number 3 Overworking

00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:00.181
When you're constantly pushing 

00:01:00.182 --> 00:01:01.480
yourself without taking breaks

00:01:01.481 --> 00:01:02.626
it wears you down 

00:01:02.627 --> 00:01:04.600
Overworking can lead to burnout,

00:01:04.601 --> 00:01:06.740
stress, and mental exhaustion

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.720
Number 2 People pleasing

00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:12.092
Always putting others needs first leaves 

00:01:12.093 --> 00:01:14.060
little room to prioritize your own

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.576
Again, this can lead to 

00:01:15.577 --> 00:01:17.520
resentment and feeling unappreciated,

00:01:17.521 --> 00:01:19.660
which can really affect your mental health

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.580
Number 1 Isolation

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.680
While isolating can feel protective,

00:01:24.681 --> 00:01:26.520
but because we are social creatures,

00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:28.082
staying away from others for 

00:01:28.083 --> 00:01:30.501
